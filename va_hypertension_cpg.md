QUALIFYING STATEMENTS
```
The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense guidelines are based upon the best

information available at the time of publication. They are designed to provide information and assist

decision making. They are not intended to define a standard of care and should not be construed as one.

Neither should they be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management.

This Clinical Practice Guideline is based on a systematic review of both clinical and epidemiological

evidence. Developed by a panel of multidisciplinary experts, it provides a clear explanation of the logical

relationships between various care options and health outcomes while rating both the quality of the

evidence and the strength of the recommendation.

Variations in practice will inevitably and appropriately occur when clinicians take into account the needs of

individual patients, available resources, and limitations unique to an institution or type of practice. Every

healthcare professional making use of these guidelines is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of

applying them in the setting of any particular clinical situation.

These guidelines are not intended to represent Department of Veterans Affairs or TRICARE policy. Further,

inclusion of recommendations for specific testing and/or therapeutic interventions within these guidelines

does not guarantee coverage of civilian sector care. Additional information on current TRICARE benefits

## I. Introduction

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) Evidence-Based Practice Work

Group (EBPWG) was established and first chartered in 2004, with a mission to advise the Health Executive

Committee (HEC) “...on the use of clinical and epidemiological evidence to improve the health of the

population...” across the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Military Health System (MHS), by

facilitating the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the VA and DoD populations.[ 1] This

CPG is intended to provide healthcare providers with a framework by which to evaluate, treat, and

manage the individual needs and preferences of patients with hypertension (HTN), thereby leading to

improved clinical outcomes.

In 2014, the VA and DoD published a CPG for the Diagnosis and Management of Hypertension in the

Primary Care Setting (2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG), which was based on evidence reviewed through April 2014.

Since the release of that guideline, a growing body of research has expanded the general knowledge and

understanding of HTN. Consequently, a recommendation to update the 2020 VA/DoD HTN CPG was

initiated in 2018. The updated 2020 VA/DoD HTN CPG includes objective, evidence-based information on

the diagnosis and management of HTN. It is intended to assist healthcare providers in all aspects of patient

care, including, but not limited to, screening, diagnosis, and management. The system-wide goal of

evidence-based guidelines is to improve the patient’s health and well-being by guiding health providers

who are caring for patients with HTN along management pathways that are supported by the evidence.

The expected outcome of successful implementation of this guideline is to:

- Assess the individual’s condition and determine the best treatment method, in collaboration with
    the patient
- Optimize health outcomes and improve quality of life
- Minimize preventable complications and morbidity

## • Emphasize the use of patient-centered care (PCC)


## II. Background......................................................................................................................................

This guideline, developed under the auspices of the VHA and the DoD pursuant to directives from the VA,

is an update to the 2014 VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Diagnosis and Management of

Hypertension in the Primary Care Setting.

The definition of HTN continues to evolve and an international consensus does not exist. The Seventh

Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High

Blood Pressure (JNC 7), published in 2003, defined HTN as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140 mm Hg

or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90 mm Hg. This definition was not changed in the 2014 Evidence

Based Guideline for the Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults.[2] Prehypertension was

classified as SBP 120-139 or DBP 80-89.[3] The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart

Association (ACC/AHA) defines HTN as an SBP ≥130 mm Hg, a DBP ≥80 mm Hg, or both.[4]

Prehypertension was removed as a clinical term; however, elevated blood pressure was added and

defined as an SBP of 120-129 with a DBP <80 mm Hg. For the purposes of this CPG, the Work Group,

based on our review of the literature, defines HTN as an SBP ≥130 mm Hg, a DBP ≥90 mm Hg, or both,

assuming proper measurement technique.

The reason for the evolution over time in the definition of HTN is because the evidence base supporting

the benefits of treatment continue to change. While the relationship between systemic arterial pressure

and cardiovascular morbidity or mortality appears to be linear above 115/75 mm Hg based on

epidemiologic data, the evidence supporting benefit from treatment of elevated blood pressure starts at a

higher threshold.[ 5] Kaplan and Victor suggests the definition of HTN should be the point at which the

benefit of treatment of elevated blood pressure outweighs the risks and cost.[6] Treatment of HTN has

long been associated with benefit, but this treatment benefit has not been proven for lowering slightly

elevated blood pressures to a “normal” blood pressure of 115/75 mm Hg. In this CPG, the Work Group

specifically investigated the point of proven benefit for HTN treatment (see Recommendation 9); based on

this evidence, the Work Group defines HTN as SBP and/or DBP at or above 130/90 mm Hg, assuming

proper measurement technique. For those with a blood pressure above “normal” but not in the

hypertensive range, there is no evidence to date that there is a benefit from treatment; however, their

cardiovascular risk remains elevated.

HTN is described as either primary or secondary HTN. Primary, or essential, HTN accounts for about 95% of

cases and is a heterogeneous disorder in which different causal factors, including genetic predisposition,

central adiposity, sedentary lifestyle, and dietary choices, can lead to high blood pressure.[7] Secondary

HTN is high blood pressure that results from an underlying and identifiable cause.[8] Main causes of

secondary HTN include adverse effects (AEs) of medications (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

[NSAIDs], corticosteroids, decongestants, hormonal contraception, erythropoietin, amphetamines –

prescription or illicit) or illegal drugs, renovascular disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), obstructive sleep

apnea (OSA), hyperaldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, aortic coarctation, and others.

Complications of HTN include damage to the large arteries (macrovascular complications) that can lead to

stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), or peripheral arterial disease, as well as damage to the smaller arteries

(microvascular complications) that can lead to CKD, lacunar infarcts, multi-infarct dementia, or


retinopathy. In addition to these arterial complications, HTN itself can lead to cardiac complications

including diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and chronic heart failure (CHF) with

preserved or reduced ejection fraction. Treatment of HTN reduces the risk of these complications.

### A. Epidemiology and Impact in the General Population

Blood pressure is a continuous variable that increases with advancing age similar to the increase in

associated comorbid conditions like coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, peripheral vascular

disease, and CKD.[5] This hypertensive risk is elevated in persons with diabetes and/or CKD. Over 66% of

both men and women 65 years of age and over have HTN compared to <15% of men and women between

20 and 44 years of age.[9] HTN is more common in older adults; in 2016, a higher percentage of men 20-

versus >64 years old (33% versus 16%) were unaware they had HTN. The asymptomatic nature of HTN can

lead to challenges with detection; therefore, routine screening is important in order to diagnose the

condition. Also, the asymptomatic nature of HTN can lead to challenges with adherence to treatment. In

African Americans, HTN develops at a younger age and may present with a higher prevalence of

complications at the time of diagnosis, including stroke and end-stage kidney disease, when compared

with other ethnic groups.[ 10 ]

The definition of HTN has evolved over the past five decades as clinical trials have progressively lowered

the level of blood pressure at which the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks. Based on National

Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 9,623 participants studied between 2011

and 2014, it is estimated that 72 million (or about one in three adult Americans) have HTN using the

definition of SBP ≥140 and DBP ≥90 mm Hg published in the JNC 7 guidelines in 2003.[3,11] By the eighth

decade of life, over 75% meet the aforementioned criteria, most commonly based on systolic elevation. In

2017, the AHA/ACC high blood pressure guideline recommended that the definition of HTN be lowered to

130/80 mm Hg or higher based on new clinical trial evidence of cardiovascular benefit from treatment to

lower targets.[11] The implication of this recommendation is that an additional 14% of the adult United

States (U.S.) population (or 31 million Americans) now meet the blood pressure criteria for HTN.[4]

### B. Hypertension in the Department of Defense and the Department of

### Veterans Affairs Populations

Estimates of HTN prevalence among active duty military are limited and undoubtedly skewed by policies

that exclude recruitment of individuals who already have cardiovascular risk factors such as HTN, obesity,

and diabetes. However, it was reported in 2008 that 13% of active duty military had HTN,[ 12] similar to the

percentage in the general population 20-44 years of age.[9] As in the civilian population, increased age,

increased body mass index (BMI), male sex, and African American race were all independently associated

with HTN. Compared to active duty military not deployed, exposure to multiple stressful deployments was

also associated with a new diagnosis of HTN.[ 13] In the first study to directly compare cardiovascular

health metrics of active duty Army men and women with those of NHANES participants evaluated

between 2011 and 2012, NHANES participants had a higher prevalence of ideal blood pressure defined as

<120/80 mm Hg (46% versus 27% for men, 63% versus 52% for women) compared to active duty Army

personnel, even though NHANES participants were considerably older than the Army personnel (only 50%

of NHANES participants <40 years old versus 86% of Army personnel <40 years old).[14]


The prevalence of HTN among Veterans was 37% in 2011.[15] Although more recently published data on

prevalence of HTN among Veterans is lacking, this prevalence is lower than the 46% reported for the U.S.

general population, which was based on data accumulated between 2013 and 2016.[ 16] The reported

blood pressure control rate, based on a treatment goal of <140/90 mm Hg, was 76.3% in 2010, which

shows that blood pressure control among Veterans is better than that reported in the general

population.[9]

This CPG on the management of HTN in the primary care setting is intended to promote evidence-based

management of HTN and thereby improve patients’ clinical outcomes. It can assist primary care providers

in the screening and diagnosis of HTN, determination of appropriate treatment, and delivery of

individualized interventions. Although it was developed for a broad range of clinical settings, it should be

applied with enough flexibility to accommodate local practice and individual situations.

## III. About this Clinical Practice Guideline

This updated guideline represents a significant effort toward improving the screening, diagnosis, and

management of HTN among patients who are eligible to receive care in the VA and/or DoD healthcare

systems. As with other CPGs, however, challenges remain. These include evidence gaps, as well as ongoing

needs to develop effective strategies for guideline implementation and to evaluate the effect of guideline

adherence on clinical outcomes. This guideline is intended for VA and DoD healthcare primary care

practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, dietitians, pharmacists,

social workers, and others involved in the team caring for patients with HTN. Additionally, this guideline is

intended for those in community practice involved in the care of Service Members or Veterans with HTN.

As elaborated in the qualifying statement on page one, this CPG is not intended to serve as a standard of

care. Standards of care are determined based on all clinical data available for an individual patient and are

subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns evolve. This CPG is based

on information available through March 25, 2019 and is intended to provide a general guide to best

practices. The guideline can assist care providers, but the use of a CPG must always be considered as a

recommendation within the context of a variety of factors such as providers’ clinical judgment, patient

values and preferences, state and federal legal statutes, ethical guidelines, professional standards, and

healthcare system policies.

### A. Methods

The current document is an update to the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG. The methodology used in developing

the 2020 VA/DoD HTN CPG follows the _Guideline for Guidelines_ , an internal document of the VA and DoD

EBPWG that was updated in January 2019.[17] The _Guideline for Guidelines_ can be downloaded from

[http://www.healthquality.va.gov/policy/index.asp.](http://www.healthquality.va.gov/policy/index.asp.) This document provides information regarding the

process of developing guidelines, including the identification and assembly of the Guideline Champions

(Champions) and other subject matter experts (SMEs) from within the VA and DoD (known as the Work

Group) and the development and submission of an updated HTN CPG.

The Champions and Work Group for this CPG were charged with developing evidence-based clinical

practice recommendations and writing and publishing a guideline document to be used by primary care


providers within the VA/DoD healthcare systems as well as those within the community who treat

individuals within the VA and DoD. Specifically, the Champions and Work Group members for this

guideline were responsible for identifying the key questions (KQs) of the most clinical relevance,

importance, and interest for the diagnosis and management of patients with HTN. The Champions and the

Work Group also provided direction on inclusion and exclusion criteria for the evidence review and

assessed the level and quality of the evidence. The amount of new scientific evidence that had

accumulated since the previous version of the CPG was also taken into consideration in the identification

of the KQs. In addition, the Champions assisted in:

- Identifying appropriate disciplines of individuals to be included as part of the Work Group
- Directing and coordinating the Work Group
- Participating throughout the guideline development and review processes

The VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value, in collaboration with the Office of Evidence Based Practice, U.S.

Army Medical Command, the proponent for CPGs for the DoD, identified four clinical leaders, William

Cushman, MD and Dan Berlowitz, MD, MPH from the VA and CDR Travis E. Harrell, MD, FACC, FACP and

CDR Mark P. Tschanz, DO, MACM, FACP from the DoD, as Champions for the 2020 VA/DoD HTN CPG.

The Lewin Team, including The Lewin Group, Duty First Consulting, ECRI Institute, Sigma Health Consulting,

and Anjali Jain Research & Consulting, was contracted by the VA and DoD to support the development of

this CPG and conduct the evidence review. The first conference call was held in October 2018, with

participation from the contracting officer’s representative (COR), leaders from the VA Office of Quality,

Safety and Value and the DoD Office of Evidence Based Practice, and the Champions. During this call,

participants discussed the scope of the guideline initiative, the roles and responsibilities of the Champions,

the project timeline, and the approach for developing and prioritizing specific research questions on which

to base a systematic review (SR) about the diagnosis and management of HTN. The group also identified a

list of clinical specialties and areas of expertise that are important and relevant to the management of

HTN, from which Work Group members were recruited. The specialties and clinical areas of interest

included: internal medicine, family medicine, nephrology, cardiology, nutrition, nursing, and pharmacy.

The guideline development process for the 2020 VA/DoD HTN CPG update consisted of the following

steps:

1. Formulating and prioritizing KQs and defining critical outcomes
2. Convening a patient focus group
3. Conducting the systematic evidence review
4. Convening a face-to-face meeting with the CPG Champions and Work Group members to develop
    recommendations
5. Drafting and submitting a final CPG on the management of HTN to the VA/DoD EBPWG

Appendix A provides a detailed description of each of these tasks.

#### a. Grading Recommendations

The Champions and Work Group used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and

Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of the evidence base and assign a strength for each


recommendation. The GRADE system uses the following four domains to assess the strength of each

recommendation:[18]

- Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes
- Confidence in the quality of the evidence
- Patient or provider values and preferences
- Other implications, as appropriate, e.g.:

```
♦ Resource use
```
```
♦ Equity
```
```
♦ Acceptability
```
```
♦ Feasibility
```
```
♦ Subgroup considerations
```
Additional information regarding these domains can be found in Appendix A.

Using these four domains, the Work Group determined the relative strength of each recommendation

(“Strong” or “Weak”). Generally, a “Strong” recommendation indicates a high confidence in the quality of

the available scientific evidence, a clear difference in magnitude between the benefits and harms of an

intervention, similar patient or provider values and preferences, and understood influence of other

implications (e.g., resource use, feasibility). Generally, if the Work Group has less confidence after the

assessment across these domains and believes that additional evidence may change the recommendation,

it assigns a “Weak” recommendation. It is important to note that the GRADE terminology used to indicate

the assessment across the four domains (i.e., “Strong” versus “Weak”) should not be confused with the

clinical importance of the recommendation. A “Weak” recommendation may still be important to the

clinical care of a patient with HTN.

Occasionally, instances may occur when the Work Group feels there is insufficient evidence to make a

recommendation for or against a particular therapy or preventive measure. This can occur when there is

an absence of studies on a particular topic that met the evidence review inclusion criteria, studies included

in the evidence review report conflicting results, or studies included in the evidence review report

inconclusive results regarding the desirable and undesirable outcomes.

Using these elements, the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum:

- Strong for (or “We recommend offering this option ...”)
- Weak for (or “We suggest offering this option ...”)
- No recommendation for or against (or “There is insufficient evidence...”)
- Weak against (or “We suggest not offering this option ...”)
- Strong against (or “We recommend against offering this option ...”)


The grade of each recommendation made in the 2020 VA/DoD HTN CPG can be found in the section on

Recommendations. Additional information regarding the use of the GRADE system can be found in

Appendix A.

#### b. Reconciling 2014 Clinical Practice Guideline Recommendations

Evidence-based CPGs should be current, which typically requires revisions of previous guidelines based on

new evidence or as scheduled and subject to time-based expirations.[19] For example, the U.S. Preventive

Services Task Force (USPSTF) has a process for refining or otherwise updating its recommendations

pertaining to preventive services.[20]

The HTN CPG Work Group largely focused on developing new and updated recommendations based on

the evidence review conducted for the priority areas addressed by the KQs. In addition to those new and

updated recommendations, the Work Group considered, without complete review of the relevant

evidence, the current applicability of other recommendations that were included in the 2014 VA/DoD HTN

CPG, subject to evolving practice in today’s environment.

A set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used by the National Institute for Health and

Care Excellence (NICE).[21,22] These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to

account for the various ways in which older recommendations could have been updated. In brief, the

categories considered whether or not the evidence that related to a recommendation was systematically

reviewed, the degree to which the recommendation was modified, and the degree to which a

recommendation is relevant in the current care environment and within the scope of the CPG. Additional

information regarding these categories and their definitions can be found in Recommendation

Categorization. The categories for the recommendations included in the 2020 version of the guideline can

be found in the section on Recommendations. The categories for the recommendations carried forward

from the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG are noted in Appendix D.

#### c. Peer Review Process

The CPG was developed through an iterative process in which the Work Group produced multiple drafts of

the CPG. The process for developing the initial draft is described in more detail in Drafting and Submitting

the Final Clinical Practice Guideline.

Once a near-final draft of the guideline was agreed upon by the Champions and Work Group members, the

draft was sent out for peer review and comment. The draft was posted on a wiki website for a period of 14

business days.

The peer reviewers comprised individuals working within the VA and DoD healthcare systems as well as

experts from relevant outside organizations designated by the Work Group members. Organizations that

were designated by the Work Group to participate in the peer review and provided feedback included the

following:

- American Association of Nurse Practitioners
- Mayo Clinic
- Scripps Clinic
- Tulane University of Medicine


The VA and DoD Leadership reached out to both the internal and external peer reviewers to solicit their

feedback on the CPG. Reviewers were provided a hyperlink to the wiki website where the draft CPG was

posted. All feedback from the peer reviewers was discussed and considered by the Work Group.

Modifications made throughout the CPG development process were made in accordance with the

evidence.

### B. Summary of Patient Focus Group Methods and Findings

When forming guideline recommendations, consideration should be given to the values of those most

affected by the recommendations: patients. Patients bring perspectives, values, and preferences into their

healthcare experience that can vary from those of clinicians. These differences can affect decision making

in various situations and should be highlighted and made explicit due to their potential to influence a

recommendation’s implementation.[23,24] Focus groups can be used as an efficient method to explore

ideas and perspectives of a group of individuals and collect qualitative data on a thoughtfully

predetermined set of questions.

Therefore, as part of the effort to update this CPG, VA and DoD Leadership, along with the HTN CPG

Work Group, held a patient focus group. The patient focus group was held on January 23,^2019 at the

Naval Medical Center in San Diego, CA. The aim of the focus group was to further understand and

incorporate the perspective of patients with HTN and who are covered and/or receiving their care

through the VA and/or DoD healthcare systems, as these patients are most affected by the

recommendations put forth in the CPG. The focus group lasted for approximately three hours and

delved into the patients’ perspectives on a set of topics related to their HTN management, including

their priorities, the challenges they have experienced, the information they received regarding their

care, and the impacts of their care on their lives.

The focus group comprised a convenience sample, and the Work Group recognizes the lack of

generalizability and other limitations inherent in the small sample size. A total of three patients and one

caregiver were included in the focus group to be consistent with the requirements of the Federal

Paperwork Reduction Act, 1980. The Work Group acknowledges that the sample included in this focus

group is not representative of all patients within the VA and DoD healthcare systems. Further, time

limitations for the focus group prevented exhaustive exploration of all topics related to HTN management

in the VA and DoD and the patients’ broader experiences with their care. Thus, the Work Group made

decisions regarding the priority of topics to discuss at the focus groups. These limitations, as well as others,

were considered during guideline development as the information collected from the discussion was being

used. Recruitment for participation in the focus groups was managed by the Champions and VA and DoD

Leadership, with assistance from coordinators at the facilities at which the focus groups took place.

The following ideas and suggestions about aspects of care that are important to patients with HTN

emerged as recurring themes during the discussions (Table 1). These concepts were important parts of the

participants’ care and added to the Work Group’s understanding of patient values and perspectives.

Additional details regarding the patient focus group methods and findings can be found in Appendix B.


**Table 1. Hypertension CPG Focus Group Concepts**

```
Patient Focus Group Themes
A. Provide comprehensive information and education to patients regarding their condition, management
strategies, and self-management, including expanding available information on complementary and alternative
therapies.
B. Improve the method of measuring blood pressure in the office.
C. Education around home monitoring devices and strategies for measurement and management, including
frequency of measurement, is important.
D. Improve communication between providers and patients, considering patient preferences regarding frequency
of communication and mode of communication.
E. All patients understood the importance of lifestyle modifications to lower their blood pressure.
```
### C. Conflicts of Interest

At the start of this guideline development process and at other key points throughout, the project team

was required to submit disclosure statements to reveal any areas of potential conflict of interest (COI) in

the past 24 months. The project team followed the guidance on COI management from the VA/DoD

EBPWG. Verbal affirmations of no COI were used as necessary during meetings throughout the guideline

development process. The project team was also subject to random web-based surveillance (e.g., Centers

for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS] open payments or ProPublica).

If a project team member reported a COI (actual or potential), then it was reported to the VA and DoD

program offices. It was also discussed with the HTN CPG Champions in tandem with their review of the

evidence and development of recommendations. The VA and DoD program offices and the HTN CPG

Champions determined whether or not action, such as restricting participation or voting on sections

related to the conflict or removal from the Work Group, was necessary. If it was deemed necessary, action

to mitigate the COI was taken by the Champions and VA and DoD program offices, based on the level and

extent of involvement. No COIs were identified for the HTN CPG Work Group members or Champions.

Disclosure forms are on file with the VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value and available upon request.

### D. Scope of this Clinical Practice Guideline

Regardless of setting, any patient in the VA and DoD healthcare systems should ideally have access to the

interventions that are recommended in this guideline after taking into consideration the patient’s specific

circumstances.

Guideline recommendations are intended to be patient centered. Thus, treatment and care should

consider a patient’s needs and preferences. Effective, open communication between healthcare

professionals and the patient is essential and should be supported by evidence-based information tailored

to the patient’s needs. Use of an empathetic and non-judgmental approach facilitates discussions sensitive

to gender, culture, ethnic, and other considerations. The information that patients are given about

treatment and care should be culturally appropriate and available to people with limited literacy skills.

Treatment information should also be accessible to people with additional needs such as physical, sensory,

or learning disabilities. Family and caregiver involvement should be considered, if appropriate.

This CPG is designed to assist in managing or co-managing patients with HTN. Moreover, the patient

population of interest for this CPG is patients with HTN who are eligible for care in the VA and DoD


healthcare delivery systems and those who are in the community receiving care from community-based

clinicians. It includes Veterans as well as deployed and non-deployed active duty Service, Guard, and

Reserve Members and their dependents.

### E. Highlighted Features of this Clinical Practice Guideline

The 2020 edition of the VA/DoD HTN CPG is the third update to the original CPG. It provides practice

recommendations for the care of individuals with HTN as well as guidance for treatment. A particular

strength of this CPG is the multidisciplinary stakeholder involvement from its inception, ensuring

representation from the broad spectrum of clinicians engaged in the diagnosis and management of HTN.

The framework for recommendations in this CPG considered factors beyond the strength of the evidence,

including balancing desired outcomes with potential harms of the intervention, the potential for variation

in patient values and preferences, and other considerations (e.g., resource use, subgroup considerations)

as appropriate. Applicability of the evidence to VA/DoD populations was also taken into consideration. An

algorithm accompanies the guideline to provide an overview of the recommendations in the context of the

flow of patient care and to assist with training providers (see Algorithm section). The algorithm may be

used to help facilitate translation of guideline recommendations into practice.

### F. Patient-centered Care

VA/DoD CPGs encourage providers to use a PCC approach that is individualized based on patient needs,

characteristics, and preferences. Regardless of setting, all patients in the healthcare system should be able

to access evidence-based care appropriate to their specific needs or condition. When properly executed,

PCC may decrease patient anxiety, increase trust in clinicians, and improve treatment adherence.[25, 26 ]

Improved patient-clinician communication and a PCC approach conveys openness and supports disclosure

of current and future concerns. As part of the PCC approach, providers should ask each patient about any

concerns he or she has or barriers to high quality care he or she has experienced.

### G. Shared Decision Making

Throughout this VA/DoD CPG, the authors encourage clinicians to focus on shared decision making (SDM).

The SDM model was introduced in _Crossing the Quality Chasm_ , an Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now called

the National Academy of Medicine [NAM]) report, in 2001.[27] It is readily apparent that patients,

together with their clinicians, make decisions regarding their plan of care and management options.

Patients with HTN require sufficient information and time to be able to make informed decisions. Clinicians

must be adept at presenting information to their patients regarding treatments, expected outcomes, and

levels and/or locations of care. Clinicians are encouraged to use SDM to individualize treatment goals and

plans based on patient capabilities, needs, goals, and preferences.

### H. Co-occurring Conditions

Co-occurring health conditions are important to recognize because they can modify the degree of risk and

trajectory of an individual’s lifestyle, impact the diagnosis and management of HTN, influence patient or

provider treatment priorities and clinical decisions, and affect the overall provider approach to the

management of HTN. Providers should expect that many Veterans, Service Members, and their families

will have one or more co-occurring health conditions. Because of the nature of HTN management, which

sometimes takes place in parallel with ongoing care for co-occurring conditions, it is often best to manage


HTN collaboratively with other care providers. Some co-occurring conditions may require early specialist

consultation in order to discuss any necessary changes in treatment or to establish a common

understanding of how care will be coordinated and delivered. VA/DoD CPGs exist for CKD,^1 d iabetes,^2

obesity and overweight,^3 and pregnancy.^4

### I. Implementation

This CPG and algorithm are designed to be adapted by individual healthcare providers with consideration

of local needs and resources. The algorithms serve as tools to prompt providers to consider key decision

points during an episode of care.

Although this CPG represents the recommended practices on the date of its publication, medical

practice is evolving and requires ongoing awareness by providers of newly published information. New

technology and additional research will improve patient care in the future. The CPG can assist in

identifying priority areas for research and informing optimal allocation of resources. Future studies

examining the results of CPG implementation may lead to the development of new evidence particularly

relevant to clinical practice.

## V. Algorithm

This CPG includes an algorithm that is designed to facilitate understanding of the clinical pathways and

decision-making processes used in managing patients with HTN. The use of the algorithm format as a way

to represent patient management was chosen based on the understanding that such a format may

promote more efficient diagnostic and therapeutic decision making; it also has potential to change

patterns of resource use. Although the Work Group recognizes that not all clinical practices are linear, the

simplified linear approach depicted through the algorithm and its format allows the provider to assess the

critical information needed at the major decision points in the clinical process. It includes:

- An ordered sequence of steps of care
- Recommended observations and examinations
- Decisions to be considered
- Actions to be taken

For each VA/DoD CPG, there is a corresponding clinical algorithm that is depicted by a step-by-step

decision tree. Standardized symbols are used to display each step in the algorithm, and arrows connect the

numbered boxes indicating the order in which the steps should be followed.[28]

### A. Screening, Diagnosis, and Monitoring

#### a. Screening

#### Recommendation

1. We recommend screening adults for elevated blood pressure periodically.
    **(Strong for | Not Reviewed, Amended)**

#### Discussion

A 2007 review of the evidence for the USPSTF describes the rationale for blood pressure screening.[29]

Based on their review, the USPSTF concluded that the benefits of blood pressure screening far outweigh

any risks. The risk for cardiovascular events and the potential benefit from screening and subsequent

treatment of HTN depend on both the degree and duration of blood pressure elevation and the presence

of other cardiovascular risk factors, such as age, gender, lipid disorders, smoking, and diabetes. Because

the degree and duration of blood pressure elevation are unknown before screening, selective screening to

identify individuals who would benefit most from detection and treatment of HTN would need to target

individuals with other cardiovascular risk factors. The 2015 update from the USPSTF concluded that, given

the strong evidence base for the previous recommendations, the indirect evidence path for HTN screening

did not need updating.[30]

For patients who are screened, estimates of the potential benefit of treatment can be improved both by

carefully measuring the degree of blood pressure elevation and by assessing the contribution of other risk

factors to global cardiovascular risk.[31- 33 ] Since increasing age is related to greater incidence of HTN, and

because lifetime risk of developing HTN is so high (reaching approximately 90% for octogenarians), it is

sensible to screen periodically.[34]

Multiple separate guidelines make recommendations for rescreening intervals, but none are evidence

based. Although not included in the systematic evidence review conducted as part of this guideline

update, and thus not considered in determining the strength of recommendation, a 2015 SR by the

USPSTF identified 40 studies addressing rescreening interval and hypertensive incidence in screened

normotensive persons (defined as blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg using office blood pressure

measurements).[35] There were highly variable estimates of incident HTN ranging from 2.2-4.4% at one-

year interval and 2.1-28.4% at five-year intervals. This confirms the recommendation that there is value

to screening normotensive adults, but the evidence remains unclear as to what the optimal interval

should be.

As this is a _Not Reviewed, Amended_ recommendation, the Work Group did not systematically review

evidence related to this recommendation. Based on the assessment of the quality of the evidence put

forth in the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG,[ 29,31-34] the Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence

is moderate. The body of evidence had some limitations including different treatment goals/targets and

confounders in the analysis. Other considerations regarding this recommendation included the benefits,

including improved outcomes in cardiovascular events and mortality, outweighing the potential harm of

adverse events (e.g., false positive screening, missed diagnosis), which was small. Patient values and

preferences were similar, as blood pressure screening is a routine part of almost all outpatient medical

care. Thus, the Work Group decided that a “Strong for” recommendation was warranted.


More research is needed on the best screening method for HTN as well as the best interval between

screenings in both the general population and those at-risk for HTN.

#### b. Measurement Techniques

#### Recommendation

2. We suggest using attended or unattended, fully automated office blood pressure measurement
    (programmed to wait five minutes and record the average of three measurements separated by at
    least 30 seconds).
    **(Weak for | Reviewed, New-added)**
3. When fully automated blood pressure measurement is not available, we suggest measurement of
    blood pressure using standard technique and a properly calibrated and validated
    sphygmomanometer.
    **(Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced)**

#### Discussion

The diagnosis and management of HTN has been based primarily on measurement of blood pressure in a

medical clinic or office. Office measurements were used by most observational studies and all randomized

controlled trials (RCTs) defining both the risk of various blood pressure levels and the goal blood pressures

that have reduced cardiovascular outcomes or mortality. To obtain the values most representative of the

patient’s office blood pressure, evidence supports that at least two readings be taken on each of two

occasions, at least one day apart. Blood pressure was measured by standard technique in all critical studies

that have been used to develop recommendations for both the blood pressure levels at which to begin

drug treatment as well as the blood pressure goals of treatment. Therefore, in order to make appropriate

decisions in clinical practice, blood pressure should be measured with a properly calibrated and validated

sphygmomanometer and with a standard technique similar to what has been used in studies.[36] Older

studies used manual blood pressure determinations, such as with a mercury sphygmomanometer, while

more recent studies have used fully automated oscillometric sphygmomanometers. A fully automated

oscillometric manometer can be set to wait a specified rest time and take an average of several blood

pressure readings with one activation. A semi-automated oscillometric device takes a single reading

without a rest period after activation.

SRs and meta-analyses have reported that blood pressure readings were similar when comparing fully

automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer with daytime average ambulatory blood pressure readings,

but routine office readings without standard technique averaged 7.0 to 14.5 mm Hg higher than fully

automated readings.[37, 38 ] In one SR, SBP readings using research quality manual or oscillometric

technique averaged 7 mm Hg higher than fully automated oscillometric technique; however, in the one

study included in the SR in which the order was randomized, there was very little difference between

these two techniques, suggesting the others may have been biased by regression to the mean.[38] In

addition, another SR/meta-analysis concluded that, when fully automated oscillometric readings were

obtained, there was not a significant difference in blood pressure levels when an observer was in the room

(attended) or the patient was alone in the room (unattended).[39]


As a good summary of standard measurement technique used in research studies, the 2019 AHA

recommendations for blood pressure measurement include the following key steps about proper seated

blood pressure measurement in the office (adapted).[36]

**Table 2. Key Steps for Proper Blood Pressure Measurements**

```
Key Steps Specific Instructions
```
```
Step 1: Properly prepare
the patient
```
1. Have the patient relax, sitting in a chair with feet flat on floor and back
    supported. The patient should be seated for 3-5 min without talking or moving
    around before recording the first blood pressure reading.
2. The patient should avoid caffeine, exercise, and smoking for at least 30 min
    before measurement.
3. Ensure that the patient has emptied his/her bladder.
4. Neither the patient nor the observer should talk during the rest period or
    during the measurement.
5. Remove clothing covering the location of cuff placement.
6. Measurements made while the patient is sitting on an examining table do not
    fulfill these criteria.

```
Step 2: Use proper
technique for blood pressure
measurements
```
1. Use an upper-arm cuff blood pressure measurement device that has been
    validated and ensure that the device is calibrated periodically.
2. Support the patient’s arm (e.g., resting on a desk) at heart level; t he patient
    should not be holding his/her arm because isometric exercise will affect the
    blood pressure levels.
3. Position the middle of the cuff on the patient’s upper arm at the level of the
    right atrium (midpoint of the sternum).
4. Use the correct cuff size such that the bladder encircles 75%-100% of the arm.
5. Use either the stethoscope diaphragm or bell for auscultatory readings.

```
Step 3: Take the proper
measurements needed for
diagnosis and treatment of
elevated blood pressure/HTN
```
1. At the first visit, record blood pressure in both arms. Use the arm that gives
    the higher reading for subsequent readings (if consistently ≥10-15 mm Hg
    higher).
2. Separate repeated measurements by at least 30 seconds.
3. For auscultatory determinations, use a palpated estimate of radial pulse
    obliteration pressure to estimate SBP. Inflate the cuff 20-30 mm Hg above this
    level for an auscultatory determination of the blood pressure level.

```
Step 4: Properly document
accurate blood pressure
readings
```
1. Record SBP and DBP; if using the auscultatory technique, record SBP and DBP
    as the onset of the first of at least 2 consecutive beats and the last audible
    sound, respectively.
2. If using the auscultatory technique, record SBP and DBP to the nearest even
    number; if oscillometric, record reading displayed (or average displayed).
3. Note the time that the most recent blood pressure medication was taken
    before measurements.

```
Step 5: Average the
readings
```
```
Use an average of ≥2 readings obtained on ≥2 occasions to estimate the patient’s
blood pressure. If fully automated oscillometric technique, manometer should
display average of 2-3 readings.
```
```
Step 6: Provide blood pressure
readings to patient
```
```
Provide the patient with his or her SBP/DBP readings both verbally and in writing.
Assist the patient interpret the results.
```
Abbreviations: DBP: diastolic blood pressure; HTN: hypertension; SBP: systolic blood pressure


The 2019 AHA guidelines on measurement of blood pressure also provide a table of proper blood pressure

cuff sizes.[36] Miscuffing can provide erroneous values.

Although SRs and meta-analyses have reported the mean differences (MD) in intra-arterial compared with

cuff blood pressure measurements and arm compared with leg blood pressure measurements, whenever

possible, decisions concerning diagnosis and management of HTN should be made with brachial cuff

determinations.[40, 41 ] Previous evidence suggested that automated blood pressure monitors are accurate

for SBP but not DBP measurement in the presence of atrial fibrillation. A recent SR and meta-analysis

provided additional support by concluding that, although some monitors have been shown to be accurate

with atrial fibrillation, there is considerable heterogeneity between devices, particularly for DBP

measurement; accuracy for devices untested in atrial fibrillation cannot be assumed.[42]

Although standard blood pressure measurement technique in the office is critical to making correct

decisions about the diagnosis and management of HTN, there is widespread failure to use proper

technique in clinical practice settings.[43] The reasons for this include lack of knowledge of proper

technique, lack of appreciation of the importance of many aspects of proper technique, and resistance to

change, especially taking the extra time needed for quiet during the rest and measurement periods. There

also may be resistance to incorporating fully automated blood pressure technique in practice, since it

requires time not speaking with the patient and allowing for rest and several measurements

(approximately seven to eight minutes on average when accounting for five minutes of rest and time to

take measurements). The main concern is the time required for busy clinic staff to incorporate this

technique. However, using automated office blood pressure (AOBP) allows staff to attend to other patients

or tasks during this time.

In the patient focus group carried out as part of this guideline update, patients described the following (see

Appendix B):

1. Patients noted that when their blood pressure was measured by machine in the office setting,
    they experienced pain and uncomfortable pressure.
2. Some of the patients noted that their blood pressure had to be taken twice when in the office
    setting, as the first reading was rarely accurate.
3. Patients felt the office blood pressure readings were inaccurate; they trusted the devices they use
    at home more.
4. There were noticeable differences between blood pressure readings when it was taken manually
    versus with a machine.


The Work Group believed these perspectives from patients generally support use of fully automated

oscillometric manometers in clinical practice. Although there is some expense to fully automated

oscillometric manometers and concern over pain of measurements, the Work Group believed these issues

were minor compared with the benefits of reducing observer error and providing more accurate blood

pressure data.

As Recommendations 2 and 3 are _Reviewed, New-added_ and _Reviewed, New-replaced_ recommendations,

respectively, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to these recommendations in the

evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update.[ 37- 42 ] The Work Group’s confidence in the

quality of the evidence is very low; however, standard blood pressure measurement technique was used in

all major observational studies and RCTs which provide evidence for risk of blood pressure levels and goal

blood pressure levels shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes with treatment. Two SRs showed that

fully automated blood pressure measurement accuracy is closer to daytime ambulatory blood pressure

measurement accuracy but that “research quality” (i.e., “standard”) measurement could also be

acceptable.[37,38] Another SR showed that fully automated readings were similar whether staff were

present in the room (attended) or the patient was left alone during the rest and measurements

(unattended).[ 39] Other considerations regarding this recommendation included the benefits of accurate

blood pressure data outweighing the potential harm of any adverse events or inconvenience, which was

small. Patient values and preferences were somewhat varied. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a

“Weak for” for these recommendations.

#### Recommendation

4. We suggest using out-of -office blood pressure monitoring methods (ambulatory 24-hour
    monitoring or home blood pressure measurements) to inform the diagnosis and management of
    hypertension.
    **(Weak for |Reviewed, New-replaced)**

#### Discussion

Out-of -office blood pressure monitoring methods comprise: (a) 24-hour and daytime/awake ambulatory

blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and (b) home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM). The 2014 VA/DoD

HTN CPG included recommendations on ABPM and HBPM to assist in the diagnosis of HTN prior to

initiation of drug therapy. The current recommendation is based on very low quality evidence from the

2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG literature review,[44- 48 ] which found that ABPM and HBPM are better predictors

of cardiovascular events compared with routine (not AOBP) office blood pressure measurements.

However, ABPM and HBPM were not used as entry criteria or as treatment goals in cardiovascular

outcome clinical trials. Moreover, with accumulating evidence that AOBP may be equivalent to ABPM and

HBPM (see Recommendation 2 and the evidence in the next paragraph), the role of ABPM and HBPM may

no longer be as important in confirming the diagnosis of HTN using out-of -office blood pressure

measurements as was thought to be the case in 2014. Furthermore, because no studies comparing ABPM

versus HBPM on clinical outcomes were identified in the present systematic evidence review, two separate

recommendations on ABPM and HBPM from the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG were combined into a single

“Weak for” recommendation.


Evidence from two SRs demonstrated that fully automated office blood pressure measurements were

similar to SBP and DBP obtained with day-time/awake ABPM and HBPM. Pappaccogli et al. (2019) showed

no significant difference for both SBP (-1.85 mm Hg) and DBP (0.12 mm Hg) in the pooled analysis of 16

studies comparing AOBP with daytime ABPM.[37] The same SR compared AOBP and HPBM using pooled

data from seven studies and also found no statistically significant difference in SBP and DBP between the

two methods. Similar findings from 19 studies were reported in another SR by Roerecke et al. (2019),

which demonstrated a non-significant pooled mean difference in SBP of 0.3 mm Hg (95% CI -1.1 to 1.7 mm

Hg) between AOBP and awake ABPM in patients who had an office SBP >130 mm Hg.[38] The Work Group

did not find any evidence comparing the predictive value of AOBP versus out-of -office blood pressure on

clinical outcomes.

Another key reason for the recommendation to preferentially use ABPM and HBPM in the 2014 VA/DoD

HTN CPG was the ability of out-of -office blood pressure to assist in the identification of white coat and

masked HTN in untreated individuals, as well as uncontrolled white coat and uncontrolled masked HTN in

patients receiving antihypertensive medications. The 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG, 2015 USPSTF,[20] and 2017

AHA/ACC [4] guidelines all recommended ruling out white coat HTN in individuals with newly diagnosed

elevated office blood pressure to avoid unnecessary initiation of drug therapy. Since the evidence review

and HTN outcome trials in general did not identify or exclude patients with white coat HTN as distinct from

other forms of HTN, it is possible that white coat HTN is not a totally benign condition. Accordingly, it is

unknown whether patients with white coat HTN benefit or do not benefit from treatment. Therefore, the

Work Group concluded there was very low quality evidence supporting the utility of out-of -office blood

pressure measurements in confirming diagnosis of HTN prior to the initiation of drug therapy.

Nevertheless, ABPM and HBPM are valuable methods in identifying masked HTN, which is diagnosed with

elevated out-of -office blood pressure in the setting of normal or controlled office blood pressure. Masked

HTN should be suspected in individuals with normal or controlled office blood pressure if they report

higher home blood pressure values, in the presence of target organ damage and certain chronic

conditions, such as CKD. We did not find any evidence of harm associated with ABPM and HBPM; however,

patient training is required for both methods, and there could be some differences in patient preferences

due to increased burden of out-of -office blood pressure monitoring. Overall, the equipment used for

HBPM is more readily available than for ABPM. Some patients may not be willing to wear a 24-hour ABPM

on multiple occasions.

As this is a _Reviewed, New-replaced_ recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence

related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update [37,38]

as well as the evidence from the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG.[ 44-48] The Work Group’s confidence in the

quality of the evidence is very low. The body of evidence had some limitations, such as observational study

design, small sample sizes, selection and attrition bias in individual studies, and a lack of consistent

reporting of blood pressure measurement methods. New considerations regarding this recommendation

included evidence that AOBP provides similar blood pressure values as day-time ambulatory and home

blood pressure, and that there are no outcome trials that have used out-of -office blood pressures as either

entry criteria or as treatment goals. While we did not identify head-to-head comparison studies between

HBPM and ABPM, both approaches seem to be of similar value for making a decision in patients in whom

the diagnosis or control of HTN remains uncertain (e.g., when AOBP is not available, when there is

significant discrepancy between self-monitored home blood pressure and office blood pressure, and if


masked HTN is suspected). HBPM is more readily available than ABPM and requires fewer resources;

however, careful patient education on proper blood pressure measurement technique and the frequency

and use of validated HBPM are recommended.

More research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of using out-of -office blood pressure to manage

HTN and whether treating to ABPM or HBPM guided blood pressure goals would improve cardiovascular

morbidity and mortality in hypertensive individuals.

#### c. Monitoring

#### Recommendation

5. Among patients treated for hypertension, we suggest offering home blood pressure self-
    monitoring with co-interventions for lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
    **(Weak for | Reviewed, New-added)**

#### Discussion

When compared with usual care, home blood pressure self-monitoring has been shown to improve SBP

and DBP control when paired with a co-intervention. Our evidence review found two SRs of RCTs

comparing blood pressure self-monitoring or HBPM with usual care.[49, 50 ] One SR of 29 RCTs showed

improved blood pressure control compared to usual care (adjusted MD in SBP 2.7 mm Hg).[49] Another SR

and meta-analysis comparing blood pressure self-monitoring alone to usual care found that self-

monitoring was not associated with lower blood pressure. However, when paired with co-interventions

(including tailored medication titration and education or lifestyle counseling) blood pressure self-

monitoring was associated with a lower blood pressure (MD in SBP -6.1 mm Hg).[50]

Three additional RCTs had results consistent with the SRs, finding self-monitoring more effective than

usual care when accompanied by a co-intervention involving medication titration in response to self-

monitoring data.[51-53] Studies in which medication adherence was examined revealed no difference in

medication adherence between self-monitoring of blood pressure and usual care.

Despite general consistency in the evidence supporting home blood pressure monitoring and self-

monitoring and ease of implementation, there is some variability in provider and patient preferences

regarding this treatment. There was some question among the Work Group members whether a 2-4 mm

Hg reduction in blood pressure was clinically significant. Some patient focus group participants expressed a

desire for additional education on the use of home blood pressure management and additional

interventions that they could institute on their own. However, some patients may not want the extra

burden of monitoring their own blood pressure at home. Other considerations include the added cost of a

home blood pressure monitor if not provided by the institution, patients in whom HBPM is not feasible,

and the additional time patients would have to devote to the co-intervention. An informational video for

patients on how to use a home blood pressure monitor is available on the VA/DoD Clinical Practice

Guidelines page.^10

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHY5MJc4Z_M&feature=youtu.be.


As this is a _Reviewed, New-added_ recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence

related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update.[ 49-53]

The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence is very low due to the subjective outcome

assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, lack of blinding, and recruitment bias. The

body of evidence had some limitations including confounders in the analysis.[49-51, 53 ] Other

considerations regarding this recommendation included the benefits of improved blood pressure and

increased participation in care, which outweigh the potential harms (none identified). Patient values and

preferences were somewhat varied. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a “Weak for” recommendation.

More research is needed on the specific co-intervention paired with HBPM to identify the most effective

intervention.

### B. Treatment Goals and General Approaches to Hypertension Management

#### a. Blood Pressure Goals

#### Recommendation

6. For all patients, including those with type 2 diabetes, we suggest treating to a systolic blood
    pressure goal of <130 mm Hg.
    **(Weak for | Reviewed, New-added)**

#### Discussion

Pharmacologic treatment of HTN has been demonstrated to decrease the risk of major adverse

cardiovascular events (MACE) such as CHD, stroke, heart failure, and overall mortality in patients with

HTN, including patients with both HTN and diabetes.[54] Treatment of SBP to a goal of less than 130 mm

Hg may lead to a reduction in cardiovascular events when compared to higher thresholds. The SR and

meta-analysis by Ettehad et al. (2016) provides evidence in support of this recommendation.[54] This

review included 78 RCTs comparing HTN treatment to placebo and 14 RCTs comparing intensive HTN

treatment to standard treatment. The effect of a 10 mm Hg reduction on the relative risk of major

cardiovascular events was estimated as a function of different baseline SBPs. Across a broad range of initial

SBPs starting at greater than 130 mm Hg, a 10 mm Hg lowering in SBP was associated with improvements

in the composite cardiovascular outcome. For people with diabetes, the SR and meta-analysis by Ettehad

et al. (2016) showed pharmacologic treatment of HTN was associated with a 12% relative risk reduction for

major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) per 10 mm Hg reduction in SBP.[54] While this relative

reduction in MACE is less than that observed in the non-diabetic population, the difference in impact

between the diabetic and the non-diabetic population is neither statistically nor clinically significant.

However, SRs limited to studies comparing a standard SBP threshold to a more intensive blood pressure

threshold in HTN patients have arrived at contradicting conclusions, likely based on differences in inclusion

criteria. The SR by Saiz et al. (2018) found no benefit of targeting an SBP threshold of 130 mm Hg when

compared to a higher SBP threshold of 150 mm Hg.[55] This mirrors the findings from the SR by Weiss et

al. (2017) that looks at studies targeting a lower threshold.[56] In contrast, the SR by Reboussin et al.

(2018) found significant reductions in the risk of major cardiovascular events associated with an SBP target

of less than 130 mm Hg.[57] The largest individual study to date examining SBP targets, the Systolic Blood

Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), included HTN patients age 50 and over and demonstrated a 25%

reduction in cardiovascular events in the intensive treatment group targeting an SBP of 120 mm Hg.[58]


Only a small proportion of SPRINT participants (those with known CVD) would have been included in the

SR by Saiz et al. (2018),[55] which could perhaps explain why Saiz et al. (2018) did not find benefits for

reducing SBP below 150 mm Hg. Specifically for HTN patients with diabetes, the SR and meta-analysis by

Brunstrom et al. (2017) suggests that benefit of treatment in patients with diabetes may be limited to

those with a baseline SBP of >140 mm Hg or to an achieved SBP of 130-140 mm Hg.[59] Overall, the

available evidence was primarily for patients with type 2 diabetes with very limited evidence for those with

#### type 1 diabetes.

As shown by the SR by Ettehad et al. (2016), the proportional reduction in the rates of cardiovascular

outcomes resulting from a 10 mm Hg reduction in blood pressure did not differ among people with prior

cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, coronary heart disease (CHD), CHF, or cerebrovascular disease.[54]

Two other SRs specifically examined the risk of stroke recurrence among patients receiving more

intensive HTN therapy.[60,61] These SRs also suggested a reduction in stroke recurrence based on

additional HTN therapy.

For many patients, benefits of intensive therapy seem to outweigh harms.[ 58, 62 ] Yet, targeting an SBP

goal of <130 does not mean that it must always be achieved; if older or particularly frail people develop

side effects while titrating therapy to achieve this lower threshold, they may wish to have medications

tapered back or changed.

The patient focus group revealed that some patients do not want to take medications for treatment of

HTN. This may limit the ability to achieve lower targets of SBP with intensive treatment, as this often

requires multiple medications and may require frequent visits.

Despite the conflicting evidence supporting an SBP goal of 130 mm Hg or less, the results from the SR by

Ettehad et al. (2016) do demonstrate benefit in lowering SBP for those between 130 and 150 mm Hg.[54]

Thus, there is strong evidence from one SR suggesting that lowering SBP by 10 mm Hg among people with

an SBP above 130 mm Hg reduces the risk of cardiovascular events.[54] However, there are inconsistencies

among other studies comparing a standard threshold with more intensive therapy. The evidence reviewed

included very few adults under the age of 60, which, based on the GRADE methodology, resulted in a

weaker recommendation. More intensive therapy often requires additional medications, which require

further resources and which some people might prefer not to take.

These results are in contrast to stronger evidence for the older population of age 60 who have

hypertension, with or without diabetes (see Recommendation 7 and Recommendation 8). The research

supporting the goal of SBP <130 mm Hg in the general HTN population, with or without diabetes, is less

robust than higher thresholds, which, according to our methodology, resulted in a weaker

recommendation for this SBP goal.

As this is a _Reviewed, New-added_ recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence

related to this recommendation to treat hypertensive adults, including those with type 2 diabetes, to an

SBP goal of less than 130 mm Hg. [54-57,59- 61 ] The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the

evidence is moderate. For people with an SBP above 130 mm Hg, a further 10 mm Hg reduction in SBP was

associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes. There is some inconsistency in the data, as SRs that

only compared a standard threshold to a more intensive threshold reached contradictory conclusions.


However, there were different inclusion criteria and methods across the SRs. The benefit of improved

cardiovascular outcomes outweighs the potential harm of AEs; however, patients may or may not be

accepting of HTN medication therapy.[ 63] Some patients are concerned over AEs of medication and may

indicate that they want to avoid or limit use of medications, when possible. Patients, however, may be

more likely to accept medications with SDM and careful titration. Based on the above, the Work Group

decided upon a “Weak for” recommendation.

Additional RCTs would be needed to definitively recommend an SBP target of less than 130 mm Hg. Given

the results of SPRINT, such a large clinical trial is unlikely to be performed in the U.S. in a general (lower

risk) hypertensive population. Ongoing clinical trials from other countries that mirror the SPRINT protocol,

or conducted among hypertensive patients excluded from or not robustly represented in SPRINT, could

provide additional evidence. In hypertension patients with diabetes, additional data from RCTs may be

available in the next few years as two large trials, Blood Pressure Control Target in Diabetes (BPROAD) and

Intervention for High-normal or Borderline-elevated Blood Pressure in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes (IPAD)

are currently enrolling in China. These trials should provide further evidence for the benefit of specific SBP

thresholds and goals in patients with diabetes.

#### Recommendation

7. For patients 60 years and over, we recommend treating to a systolic blood pressure goal of <150
    mm Hg with added benefit to lowering systolic blood pressure further for those between 130 mm
    Hg and 150 mm Hg.
    **(S trong for | Reviewed, Amended)**

#### Discussion

Among people age 60 and over with moderate to severe HTN, there is evidence that treating to an SBP

goal of 150 mm Hg or less reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This strong recommendation is

based on evidence from RCTs that compared a more intensive HTN strategy with placebo or a standard or

less intensive strategy. The SR by Weiss et al. (2017) considered adults age 60 and over from 21 RCTs, nine

of which specifically included individuals with an SBP of 160 mm Hg or higher.[56] Improved cardiovascular

outcomes were seen among those given more intensive therapy targeting an SBP less than 150 mm Hg.

Among people 60 years and over, there was also evidence of further benefit in lowering systolic blood

pressure to levels between 130 and 150 mm Hg.[56] The SR by Ettehad et al. (2016) included 78 studies

comparing HTN treatment to placebo and 14 studies comparing intensive HTN therapy to standard

treatment. Across a broad range of initial baseline SBPs greater than 130 mm Hg, a 10 mm Hg lowering in

SBP was associated with improvements in the composite cardiovascular outcome.[54] Thus, there is likely

benefit to further reductions of SBP for those patients with a baseline SBP between 130 and 150 mm Hg.

The SR by Ettehad et al. (2016) demonstrated benefit from a 10 mm Hg reduction in SBP but did not

evaluate a specific target or threshold.[54] Different SRs have come to different conclusions in

recommending a specific target for SBP less than 150 mm Hg with conclusions that are highly sensitive to

inclusion criteria of studies in the SRs. The SR by Saiz et al. (2018) considered six RCTs in hypertensive

patients with a history of CVD (MI, angina, stroke, and/or peripheral vascular occlusive disease), targeting a

blood pressure less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg when compared to standard therapy and found no


benefit for the more intensive approach.[55] This mirrors the findings from the SR by Weiss et al. (2017)

that looked at studies targeting a lower threshold.[56] In contrast, the SR by Reboussin et al. (2018) found

significant reductions in the risk of major cardiovascular events associated with an SBP target of less than

130 mm Hg.[57] The largest individual study to date examining SBP targets, the Systolic Blood Pressure

Intervention Trial (SPRINT), included HTN patients age 50 and over and demonstrated a 25% reduction in

cardiovascular events in the intensive treatment group targeting an SBP of 120 mm Hg.[58] Only a small

proportion of SPRINT participants (those with known CVD) would have been included in the SR by Saiz et

al. (2018),[55] which could perhaps explain why Saiz et al. (2018) did not find benefits for reducing SBP

below 150 mm Hg.

Treating to a lower SBP goal of <130 mm Hg for older adults is also supported by evidence, but the

research support this lower goal is weaker than the evidence for treating to a SBP goal of <150 mm Hg in

patients 60 years and older. Thus, the current recommendation is specific to HTN in patients age 60 and

over, which is supported by the large number of clinical trials that mostly included older people.

Based on the SR by Weiss et al. (2017), there is strong and consistent evidence supporting lowering SBP to

a target of 150 mm Hg.[56] Benefits clearly outweigh harms and burdens associated with this therapy.

There is less consistency in the evidence supporting additional blood pressure reductions for patients with

an SBP between 130 and 150 mm Hg. This more intensive or aggressive approach often requires additional

medications which, in turn, require further resources and which some people might not prefer.

Benefits of intensive therapy seem to outweigh harms.[58,62] Attempts at lowering systolic blood pressure

further for those between 130 mm Hg and 150 mm Hg in order to achieve lower threshold goals is not

always feasible; if older or particularly frail people develop side effects while titrating therapy to achieve

lower blood pressures, they may wish to have medications tapered back or changed.

As this is a _Reviewed, Amended_ recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence

identified in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update.[54- 58 ] For people with an SBP

between 130 and 150 mm Hg, there is high confidence in the quality of evidence that additional reductions

in blood pressure are beneficial. This is supported by the SR by Ettehad et al. (2016) which found that a 10

mm Hg reduction in SBP was associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes [ 54 ] and by the findings

of the SR by Reboussin et al. (2018).[57] There is some inconsistency in the data, as not all SRs support

further lowering of SBP across all patient groups. The benefit of improved cardiovascular outcomes

outweighs the potential harm of adverse events, and patients are generally accepting of HTN therapy.

Some patients, though, are concerned about the AEs of medication and may indicate that they want to

avoid or limit use of medications, when possible.

#### Recommendation

8. For patients 60 years and over with type 2 diabetes, we recommend treating to a systolic blood
    pressure goal of <140 mm Hg with added benefit to lowering systolic blood pressure further for
    those between 130 mm Hg and 140 mm Hg.
    **(Strong for | Reviewed, Amended)**


#### Discussion

As previously stated, pharmacologic treatment of HTN has been demonstrated to decrease the risk of

major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) such as CHD, stroke, heart failure, and overall mortality in

patients with HTN, including patients with both HTN and diabetes.[54] Based on the SR and meta-analysis

by Ettehad et al. (2016), pharmacologic treatment of HTN is associated with a 12% relative risk reduction

for MACE in patients with diabetes per 10 mm Hg reduction in SBP.[54] This review demonstrated broad

reduction in MACE regardless of baseline blood pressure down to an SBP of <130 mm Hg.

Brunstrӧm et al. (2017) performed an SR of SRs with the purpose of determining the optimal blood

pressure level and choice of antihypertensive agent in people with diabetes.[59] This study included 11 SRs

(three SRs stratified according to baseline SBP, four SRs stratified by attained SBP, and eight SRs addressed

choice of antihypertensive agent) and did not report the duration of follow-up for included studies. In

these reviews, the mean age for patients was around 60 years. Evidence from Brunstrӧm et al. (2017)

favored intensive blood pressure lowering in a general diabetic population when baseline SBP was >140

mm Hg. Achieving an SBP in the range of 130 to 140 mm Hg was associated with reduced CV events. A

lower target of <130 mm Hg or treatment when the baseline SBP was <140 mm Hg was not, however,

associated with statistically significantly improved cardiovascular outcomes or mortality. This led to

conclusions that achieving an SBP in the range of 130-140 mm Hg is associated with reduced

cardiovascular events.

There was some evidence for a reduced risk of stroke when patients were treated with antihypertensive

therapy when the baseline SBP was <140 mm Hg, though benefits on other cardiovascular outcomes were

not seen. Furthermore, there was a non-significant trend towards increased cardiovascular mortality in

this group.[59] The SR performed by Ettehad el al. (2016) [ 54 ] focused on the general population with HTN

but did have a subgroup analysis for patients with diabetes, which provided evidence for the

recommendation suggesting treating to the lower target SBP of <130 mm Hg for patients with type 2

diabetes. This is in contrast to the SR by Brunstrӧm et al. (2017) [ 59 ] which provides strong evidence for

the older population with type 2 diabetes, including patients with a history of CVD, for a target SBP of 130-

140 mm Hg.

The 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG recommended treatment to an SBP of <150 mm Hg in patients 60 years and

over with type 2 diabetes, primarily based on the results of general HTN studies which had sub-

populations with diabetes [64,65] and the HTN arm of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group.[66] In the

2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG, there was an additional suggestion to treat to an SBP of <140 mm Hg for those

patients who tolerate pharmacologic antihypertensive treatment based on evidence from the Action to

Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) and Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax

and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trials;[ 67,68] however, this evidence was only

moderate, which led to the “Weak for” recommendation in 2014. The SR by Brunstrӧm et al. (2017)

strengthened the evidence providing support for the amended “Strong for” recommendation to treat to

target SBP of <140 mm Hg and to consider additional blood pressure lowering when the SBP is between

130-140 mm Hg.[59]

The patient focus group revealed that some patients do not want to take medications for treatment of

HTN. This may limit the ability to achieve target SBP.


As this is a _Reviewed, Amended_ recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence

related to this recommendation identified in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline

update,[54,59] as well as considered evidence from the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG.[64-68] The Work Group

determined the confidence in the quality of the evidence was high in support of intensive treatment of

HTN in a general population of patients with diabetes. The benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the

harms, though we do note that there is variance in acceptance of intensive treatment from providers and

patients and many patients may not be willing to take multiple medications to achieve target SBP levels.

The evidence included in the SR conducted as part of this guideline update is primarily from patients with

diabetes type 2 who are already on pharmacologic antihypertensive treatment. These patients typically

are middle-aged or elderly (but under the age of 80 years). There is little evidence for pharmacologic

treatment to a target SBP in patients with type 1 diabetes, adults under the age of 50, or the very old (over

80 years). Future research on any of these subgroups may provide additional evidence regarding

appropriate blood pressure goals.

#### Recommendation

9. For patients 30 years and over, we recommend treating to a diastolic blood pressure goal of <90
    mm Hg.
    **(Strong for | Reviewed, Amended)**

#### Discussion

This recommendation is supported by strong clinical trial evidence demonstrating the benefits of treating

HTN to a DBP goal of less than 90 mm Hg and was carried forward from the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG.

Landmark studies, such as the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive

Agents, the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program (HDFP), and the Medical Research Council

(MRC) trial of treatment of mild HTN, all demonstrated substantial benefits in terms of reduced

cardiovascular events by treating to a target DBP of less than 90 mm Hg.[ 69- 73 ] Eligibility for these studies

differed slightly, but all included patients 30 years of age or older. Based on the SR and meta-analysis by

Saiz et al. (2018), lower target DBP goals showed no treatment benefit in mortality or cardiovascular

morbidity.[55]

This recommendation may or may not apply to patients aged 18 to 29 as clinical trials did not include

patients younger than 30. However, it is unlikely that clinical trials will address HTN treatment and optimal

DBP targets in younger adults given the low prevalence of primary HTN in younger adults. The Work Group

believes that younger adults with elevated DBP may also benefit from treatment.

The patient focus group revealed that some patients are resistant to taking medications, and lower targets

generally require more medications and more clinical follow-up. Therefore, patients should find this

recommendation acceptable. However, providers may note this recommendation differs from other

recent HTN guidelines; therefore, our guidance may be confusing. The Work Group feels it is important to

highlight for providers that there are no new RCTs providing evidence to lower the DBP target to less than

90 mm Hg (e.g., 80 mm Hg), and recommendations for a lower DBP target in other HTN guidelines are

based on expert opinion. Both of these should give providers reassurance in this recommendation when


considering treatment. The Work Group, however, did not believe it likely that there would be harm for

DBPs treated to lower levels, especially when treating SBP to the appropriate goal.[74]

As this is a _Reviewed, Amended_ recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence

related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update,[55]

as well as considered evidence from the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG.[69-73] The Work Group’s confidence in

the quality of the evidence is moderate. Other considerations regarding this recommendation included

the lack of data in patients under 30 years, thus the specified age range. Patient values and preferences

should be compatible with keeping the higher DBP target. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a “Strong

for” recommendation.

#### b. General Approaches to Hypertension Management

#### Recommendation

10. We recommend offering pharmacist-led medication management as an option for patients with
    hypertension.
    **(Strong for | Reviewed, New-replaced)**

#### Discussion

Pharmacist-led interventions have been effective in improving critical outcomes in hypertensive patients.

Interventions which have been evaluated include medication initiation, titration and monitoring, blood

pressure measurement, reminder systems, patient education regarding both medications and long-term

consequences of HTN, and physician feedback. Two SRs with large effect sizes provided much of the basis

for this recommendation.[75, 76 ] In the SR of seven RCTs by Greer et al. (2016), pharmacist-led care

significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving goal blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg versus

usual care over a median period of 39 weeks (risk ratio 1.45, 95% CI 1.24-1.70). Care was provided by the

pharmacist either in person, remotely, or a combination of the two, and some of the included studies

granted prescriptive authority.[75] The SR by Santschi et al. (2014) included 39 RCTs and compared

pharmacist-led care to usual or collaborative care in over 14,000 patients with HTN. Compared with usual

care, pharmacist-led interventions resulted in significantly greater improvements in both SBP (-8.5 mm Hg)

and DBP (-4.6 mm Hg) over the mean follow-up period of eight months.[ 76]

Four additional RCTs in the evidence base also evaluated blood pressure reduction via various pharmacist

interventions and practice sites.[ 77- 80 ] The study by Victor et al. (2019) reported a marked reduction in

blood pressure when pharmacists provided care in barbershops catering to African American men.

Significant and sustained reductions in mean SBP of approximately 20 mm Hg and mean DBP approaching

19 mm Hg were seen after 12 months in over 300 hypertensive patients versus control.[80] The lack of

blinding is a limitation to this study. The study by Cheema et al. (2018), using community pharmacists who

provided education and lifestyle and adherence advice, reported significant differences versus baseline for

reductions in both SBP and DBP.[ 78]

Interventions are not required to be face-to-face to show benefit. The SR by Santschi et al. (2014) included

a trial of home blood pressure telemonitoring and pharmacist management intervention in which the

interventions stopped after 12 months.[76] In the long-term follow-up of this study, benefits were seen

beyond the 12 month intervention period, as Margolis et al. (2018) found that there were significantly


greater reductions in SBP in the intervention group than in the usual care group at 6, 12, and 18 months

(reductions of 10.7, 9.7, and 6.6 mm Hg, respectively). However, the results were not significant when

evaluated at 53 months.[ 79] In contrast, no differences in blood pressure were noted in a small study that

compared pharmacists with an education control.[77] However, results may have been influenced by

study limitations related to low patient enrollment.

Statistically significant improvements in both medication adherence and medication use with

pharmacist-led interventions were reported in the SR by Greer et al. (2016).[75] The barbershop study

by Victor et al. (2018) showed an increase in the number of blood pressure medications per

participant.[ 80] Improved adherence in favor of a pharmacist-led intervention was shown in one study

conducted in Pakistan in which the intervention involved education.[81] There was also some evidence

of improved medication use (in terms of either the numbers of antihypertensive medications used or

adherence) in the referenced studies.

The Work Group determined that, in addition to providing education, there was a significant role for

pharmacists in actively titrating antihypertensive drugs and managing AEs. This conclusion was based on

findings from two SRs of RCTs in which pharmacists performed these higher level interventions.[75, 76 ]

Ensuring pharmacists are appropriately qualified to provide these services is also important. The study

conducted by Cheema et al. (2018) utilized community pharmacists.[ 78] However, in both the VA and DoD,

this recommendation is intended for pharmacists in the clinic setting, and not dispensing pharmacists.

Some variation was noted in patient values and preferences. The patient focus group did not discuss

pharmacist-led interventions; however, in the evidence base, patients enjoyed the flexibility and ease of

access to pharmacists and appreciated the improved access to care.[75, 80 ] The benefits of pharmacist-

led care outweighed the harms due to the low number of adverse events reported with the

interventions in the barbershop trial.[ 80 ] The SR by Greer et al. (2016) had only limited information

regarding patient satisfaction or drug-related problems.[75] This strong recommendation will have

implications for resource use, as utilization of pharmacist-led interventions for the treatment of HTN

could have significant system implications.

As this is a _Reviewed, New-replaced_ recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence

related to blood pressure management using pharmacist-led care either through in-person interactions,

via telehealth, or a combination of the two, and that specifically discussed studies related to pharmacist-

led interventions.[75- 81 ] The evidence reviewed included two SRs and five RCTs. The confidence in the

quality of evidence was moderate. The recommendation focuses on clinical pharmacists, in contrast to the

recommendation in the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG, which grouped nurses, pharmacists, and social workers

together and centered on adherence in addition to blood pressure control. Although there were variations

in the quality of the evidence for the five RCTs, the moderate quality SRs by Greer et al. (2016) and

Santschi et al. (2014) with the large effect sizes and the evidence for improved adherence led to the overall

confidence in the quality of evidence to be assessed as moderate. Other factors considered by the Work

Group for this recommendation included the improved outcomes of blood pressure reduction and blood

pressure goal attainment, which outweighed the small risk of adverse events. There was some variation in

patient values and preferences. Overall, the strength of the evidence and substantial effect sizes within the

two SRs contributed to the “Strong for” recommendation.[75,76]


#### Recommendation

11. We suggest offering nurse-led interventions as an option for patients treated for hypertension.
    **(Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced)**

#### Discussion

Nurse-led interventions for the management of HTN encompass a wide variety of treatment approaches

including cardiovascular risk assessment, education, counseling on lifestyle modification, goal setting,

action planning, and the initiation and titration of antihypertensive medications using established

protocols. When compared with usual care, nurse-led interventions have been found to reduce SBP and

DBP, improve adherence to medication therapy, and improve quality of life metrics in patients with

HTN.[ 82- 88 ] All studies reviewed by the Work Group contained multiple components of nurse-led

intervention, some paired with other co-interventions.

Our evidence review found one SR, by Parappilly et al. (2018), that compared nurse-led interventions to

usual care.[88] I t was based on 16 RCTS and enrolled a total of 3,568 participants diagnosed with a

previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. The researchers observed no statistically significant difference

in SBP and DBP changes between nurse-led interventions and usual care. H owever, the authors indicated

that one RCT was found to be an outlier. After removing this study from the meta-analysis, the models

demonstrated a statistically significant effect on reducing SBP and DBP in favor of nurse-led interventions

when compared to usual care. The authors reported a mean difference in SBP reduction of 2.84 mm Hg

and a MD in DBP reduction of 2 mm Hg, favoring nurse-led intervention. All studies included in the SR

contained multiple nurse-led components including education, lifestyle changes, providing feedback,

appointment scheduling, and medication review and compliance.[88] The Work Group identified two

additional RCTs that had results consistent with the SR by P arappilly et al. (2018) (i.e., favoring the nurse-

led intervention group).[82,84] One found a reduction in DBP similar to the SR by Parappilly et al. (2018)

(i.e., favoring the nurse-led intervention).[ 82] Three additional RCTs reported more frequent

“hypertension control” or achieving a blood pressure goal of <140/90 mm Hg in the nurse-led intervention

group when compared to the usual care control group.[83,85, 87 ] No significant harms were found with

nurse-led interventions in studies that reported on the outcome.

Medication adherence is a critical component in chronic disease management for HTN. The SR by

Parappilly et al. (2018) reported a statistically significant difference between nurse-led intervention and

usual care in the change in medication adherence at follow-up.[88] Our evidence review found one RCT

reporting a statistically significant difference in medication adherence in favor of nurse-led

intervention.[87] Another RCT, by Zhu et al. (2018), found no statistically significant difference between

nurse-led intervention and usual care in the change in medication adherence at follow-up.[82] Two

additional RCTs found no statistically significant difference between nurse-led intervention and usual care

when coupled with co-interventions such as electronic health record (EHR) tools and mobile health

technologies.[83,85] These two RCTs had small sample sizes and may have been underpowered to detect

the true intervention effect.

Two RCTs found a statistically significant change in quality of life metrics favoring the nurse-led

intervention group versus usual care.[82, 87 ] However, a third RCT, by Persell et al. (2018), found no quality


of life impact when using EHR tools alone or EHR tools plus nurse-led education with usual care or when

interventions were compared with one another.[83]

Despite general consistency in the evidence supporting the notion that nurse-led interventions inform the

management of HTN, there is some variability in provider and patient preferences. The patient focus group

revealed that some patients did not feel that their providers offered the full range of management

strategies available and prioritized pharmacologic interventions. This highlights an opportunity to utilize

nurse-led interventions for lifestyle modification. Additionally, the patient focus group found that patients

would like to be offered verbal education as well as educational materials, such as pamphlets. Some

patients reported that they did not receive information on the sequelae of high blood pressure and that

their providers did not consider individual patient characteristics that could impact their high blood

pressure and management strategies. A common theme highlighted in the patient focus group was the

desire for ongoing communication and education from providers to patients. This is a potential area in

which nurse-led intervention can fill current gaps in care. In general, nurse-led intervention is well received

by patients and most providers. Patients often appreciate nurse-led intervention due to increased

accessibility to care and time efficiency.

As this is a _Reviewed, New-replaced_ recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence

related to this recommendation identified in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline

update.[ 82- 88 ] The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence is very low for all included

studies due to the lack of objectivity of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective

reporting, small sample size, lack of blinding, and recruitment bias. The body of evidence had some

limitations including confounders in the analysis.[82-88] Other considerations regarding this

recommendation included the benefits of improved blood pressure and medication adherence

outweighing the potential harms (none identified). Patient values and preferences were somewhat varied.

Thus, the Work Group decided upon a “Weak for” recommendation.

More research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of nurse-led intervention to manage HTN in specific

subgroups (e.g., age, ethnicity, comorbidities). Additionally, more research is needed to evaluate the

effectiveness of nurse-led intervention, such as evaluating initiation and titration of antihypertensive

medications using established protocols.

#### Recommendation

12. We suggest offering registered dietitian-led nutrition interventions as an option for patients with
    hypertension who are or are not on medication.
    **(Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced)**

#### Discussion

Registered dietitian-led nutrition interventions, such as education about low sodium diets, weight loss,

and increasing consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, have been found to result in modest but

statistically significant lowering of SBP and DBP in treated and untreated hypertensive individuals.[89]

The current recommendation is based on low quality evidence from an SR by Reigel et al. (2018), which

included 4,491 patients across 13 studies, in which nutrition-based interventions resulted in lower SBP

(MD -2.82 mm Hg) and lower DBP (MD -1.37 mm Hg), as compared with the usual care.[89] However,


when studies were grouped based on whether the nutrition intervention was delivered by a registered

dietitian versus other practitioners, significant reductions in SBP (MD -3.5 mm Hg) and DBP (MD -1.37

mm Hg) were only seen in the registered dietitian-led nutrition intervention group. In addition, blood

pressure reductions were more pronounced with interventions longer than six months. No significant

harms were found with nutrition interventions.

Focus group participants highlighted that patients and caregivers strongly valued dietary interventions to

lower blood pressure. Although not systematically reviewed in this guideline update, it is generally

accepted that comprehensive dietitian-led intervention can positively impact other aspects of

cardiovascular health, such as blood lipid and glucose levels, weight loss, and alcohol cessation. However,

there may be barriers in obtaining healthy food choices for some patients. Service Members frequently do

not get a choice regarding where they are going, what they are doing, or where they will eat in a

deployed/training environment. Food sources may vary (e.g., Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), items received in

care packages, training area or forward operating base (FOB)/central operating base (COB) dining

facilities). Depending on what area of responsibility the Service Member is deployed to/training in, these

rations may be high in sodium and fat. These nutritional factors may impact HTN management and

necessitate counseling related to diet.

As this is a _Reviewed, New-replaced_ recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the

relevant evidence identified in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update.[89] The

Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence is low. The body of evidence showed overall

modest effect size, although statistically significant, and had some limitations including small size,

inadequate allocation concealment and blinding, and inclusion of dietary approach as a part of

multidisciplinary intervention in some individual studies. Other considerations regarding this

recommendation included patients’ preferences. The potential benefit of nutritional intervention to

improve global cardiovascular health outweighs potential adverse events and burden, which were not

found. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a “Weak for” recommendation.

More research is needed to evaluate intensity and duration of dietitian-led interventions to improve blood

pressure control and effectiveness of registered dietitian-led nutritional intervention to manage HTN in

specific subgroups (e.g., different ages, ethnicities).

#### Recommendation

13. We suggest technology-based interventions (e.g., e-counseling, electronic transmission of data,
    telemonitoring, mobile applications) for improving control of hypertension.
    **(Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced)**

#### Discussion

Several key words are defined to better understand this recommendation and its impact. Telehealth refers

to data communicated between the patient and provider in ways other than face-to-face interactions. This

is accomplished through a variety of methods to include use of computers, mobile devices, or mobile

applications. In contrast, telemonitoring is the use of information and communication technologies to

monitor and transmit items related to patient health status between geographically separated individuals,

which permits home monitoring of patients to include nursing or residential care homes using external


electronic devices. Methods may include e-counseling, real-time consults, electronic transmission of data

and interventions, mobile interventions, and/or interactive digital interventions. Additionally, mHealth is

defined as mobile health. The World Health Organization defines it as the use of mobile applications and

wireless technology to support the achievement of health goals.[90]

In the development of this recommendation, the Work Group considered whether concurrent treatment

impacted outcomes. The Work Group considered whether the intervention of interest was provided

instead of, or in addition to, usual care (in-person visits). Some of the possible interventions may include

mobile applications, telehealth monitoring, telehealth visits with primary care or a subspecialty. The

impact of the intervention of interest and any concurrent treatment on the following outcomes was

considered: reduction in blood pressure, change in blood pressure from baseline, achievement of lower

blood pressure goals and adherence to therapy, and percentage of patients taking medication.

In examining “instead of or in addition to usual care (in-person visits)”, two RCTs, Liu et al. (2018) [ 91] and

Nolan et al. (2018),[ 92] compared an e-counseling intervention with usual care or control. Liu et al.

observed a not statistically significant difference in SBP change between user-driven e-counseling and

control, while a statistically significant change was noted with expert-driven e-counseling.[ 91] Nolan et al.

(2018) reported a not statistically significant difference between e-counseling plus usual care for SBP and

DBP at four months.[92]

Two SRs compared mobile applications or mobile health technology with usual care or control. Alessa et

al. (2018) indicated that applications had either a positive or statistically significant positive effect on

SBP and DBP as compared to usual care or control.[93] Four of the 12 RCTS in Xiong et al. (2018)

reported a statistically significant change in either SBP or DBP in favor of mHealth interventions as

compared to usual care.[ 94] Marquez Contreras et al. (2018) reported a statistically significant

difference in SBP change in favor of the mobile application as compared to usual care.[ 95] Twelve of 21

RCTs in Xiong et al. 2018) reported a significant improvement in medication adherence in the

intervention group compared to controls.[94]

In looking at telehealth monitoring, one SR by McLean et al. (2016) included seven RCTs comparing

interactive digital interventions with usual care. McLean et al. (2016) observed statistically significant

changes in SBP and DBP in favor of interactive digital interventions compared to usual care.[96]

This recommendation looked at a variety of topics that include web-based interventions and

telemonitoring. Two SRs [97,98] and two RCTs [99, 100 ] compared telehealth visits with usual care or

control. Chen et al. (2019) and Beishuizen et al. (2016) reported statistically significant differences in favor

of web-based interventions for changes in SBP and DBP.[99, 100 ] In contrast, one RCT included in Vargas et

al. (2017) reported a not statistically significant difference in SBP change at three months.[ 98] Similarly, an

additional RCT (not included in one of the above four SRs) by McManus et al. (2018) observed no

statistically significant differences in SBP or DBP at six months.[52] One RCT included in Vargas et al.

examined medication adherence and found no statistically significant difference in medication adherence

between short message service (SMS) and control.[ 98] However, an additional RCT (not included in one of

the above four SRs) by Pan et al. compared home telemonitoring with usual care and observed statistically

significant differences in favor of home telemonitoring for SBP and DBP.[ 101] Given these conflicting

results, additional studies need to examine possible effectiveness of mHealth.[90]


Additional considerations include the confidentiality and security of all Health Insurance Portability and

Accountability Act (HIPAA)-related health information, variation in use between age population groups,

and variation in access to internet or technologies due to financial considerations.

Primary HTN continues to be a concern. Emerging technologies should be considered as a possible

additional intervention between the provider and patient to address HTN, thereby giving the provider

additional tools to teach and evaluate the patient’s progress. This recommendation’s strength is “Weak

for.” As this is a _Reviewed, New-replaced_ recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the

relevant evidence for this recommendation identified in the evidence review conducted as part of this

guideline update.[ 52,91- 101 ] The overall confidence in the quality of the evidence is very low to low. While

the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes shows that benefits slightly outweigh harms/burden,

there is a large variation of patient values and preferences. It cannot be understated that this

recommendation has a broad scope with general findings that may show a modest benefit for those

patients and providers who choose to utilize this medium.

Technologies continue to evolve at a rapid pace and new capabilities are continually emerging. Additional

studies should consider the effectiveness, safety, adherence, and overall quality of life impact on

decreasing blood pressure.

### C. Non-pharmacological Management

#### a. Weight Reduction

The following recommendations are directed towards patients with HTN and overweight/obesity. There

are benefits to weight reduction outside of treating for HTN. The various interventions may be more or less

effective for other outcomes than for the treatment of HTN. Providers may refer to the VA/DoD Clinical

Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of Obesity and Overweight for further discussion of

treatment methods for patients with overweight/obesity.^11

#### Recommendation

14. We suggest advising patients with hypertension and overweight/obesity to lose weight to improve
    blood pressure.
    **(Weak for | Reviewed, Amended)**

#### Discussion

As part of lifestyle modification, weight loss has been found to improve blood pressure in patients with

HTN and overweight/obesity. Overall, reduction in weight or BMI had a positive effect on blood

pressure.[102- 109 ]

Therefore, the Work Group suggests advising patients with HTN and overweight/obesity to lose weight to

reduce blood pressure. Although the confidence in the quality of the evidence is very low,[102-109] the

Work Group believes the benefits outweigh the harms. As far as specific interventions for weight loss, the

Work Group suggests offering diet directed at weight loss for treatment of HTN

(^11) See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of Obesity and Overweight. Available at:
https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/CD/obesity/.


(see Recommendation 15).[ 106- 108 ] Additionally, the Work Group recommends neither for nor against

weight loss medications for the treatment of HTN (see Recommendation 16).[ 103] Lastly, there is

insufficient evidence to recommend for or against bariatric surgery for the treatment of HTN in patients

with obesity and HTN (see Recommendation 17).[ 104,105]

As Recommendation 14 is a _Reviewed, Amended_ recommendation, the Work Group systematically

reviewed evidence related to this recommendation identified in the evidence review conducted as part of

this guideline update.[ 102- 109 ] The confidence in the quality of the evidence supporting dietary and

lifestyle interventions for blood pressure reduction through weight loss was low to very low. The Work

Group believes that the benefits of diet and lifestyle modifications outweigh the harms. There will be

variability in patient values and preferences, as not all patients will want to lose the weight or be accepting

of a lifestyle modification. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a “Weak for” recommendation.

#### Recommendation

15. For patients with hypertension and overweight/obesity, we suggest offering a diet directed at
    weight loss for the treatment of hypertension.
    **(Weak for | Reviewed, New-added)**

#### Discussion

The Work Group reviewed evidence on the effects of various weight loss interventions, including diet

directed at weight loss which has been found to improve blood pressure in patients with HTN. One SR

[108] and two RCTs [ 106 ,107] comprised the evidence base for diets directed at weight loss therapy.

One SR, by Semlitsch et al. (2016), assessed the long-term effects of weight-reducing diets in people with

HTN.[ 108] Three of the studies included in the SR by Semlitsch et al. (2016) examined the impact of diet

versus no diet on SBP and DBP reduction (n=731);[108] there was further blood pressure reduction in the

diet intervention group. One study included in the SR by Semlitsch et al. (2016) demonstrated significantly

reduced cardiovascular morbidity in the diet intervention group. While the study was small, there was a

large effect.[110] An RCT, by Kucharska et al. (2018), found that the Dietary Approaches to Stop

Hypertension (DASH) diet reduced blood pressure in patients with overweight/obesity and HTN.[ 107]

Another RCT, by Tay et al. (2014), studied the effects of a low-carbohydrate, high-unsaturated/low-

saturated fat diet (LC) versus a high–unrefined carbohydrate, low-fat diet (HC) on blood pressure reduction

in patients with type 2 diabetes; results were inconclusive.[106] Confidence in the quality of the evidence

is very low due to serious study limitations and imprecision. While SBP and DBP did decrease in the

intervention groups for several studies, it was not clear whether it was a clinically meaningful reduction in

blood pressure.[107,108]

As the recommendation on a diet directed at weight loss is _Reviewed, New-added_ , the Work Group

systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation identified in the evidence review

conducted as part of this guideline update.[ 106-108] The Work Group had very low confidence in the

quality of evidence supporting dietary interventions for weight loss for the treatment of HTN; there

were serious limitations and a high risk of bias. While the data was somewhat limited, the effect sizes in

the evidence were reasonably large. The benefits outweigh the harms, as only a few harms were

associated with the interventions. There is a large variation in patient preferences as there are various


versions of diet, and providers would need to get the patient to agree to participate in the dietary

intervention. Some patients would not accept the intervention. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a

“Weak for” recommendation.

#### Recommendation

16. For the treatment of hypertension, there is insufficient evidence for or against offering weight loss
    medications for patients with obesity and hypertension.
    **(Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added)**

#### Discussion

The Work Group also looked at the evidence for offering weight loss medications for patients with obesity

and HTN. There was insufficient evidence in the studies reviewed by the Work Group to recommend for or

against offering weight loss medications for the treatment of HTN.

An SR by Siebenhofer et al. (2016) compared weight loss medications (orlistat and

phentermine/topiramate) to placebo in patients with HTN.[ 103] There were statistically significant

improvements in SBP and DBP for individuals taking either orlistat (four studies with 2,058 patients) or

phentermine/topiramate (one study with 1,305 patients) compared to placebo. The study that compared

phentermine/topiramate to placebo found a high rate of low-severity side effects with use of

phentermine/topiramate (85.4% for low-dose, 88.8% for high-dose) compared to placebo (77.3%), but a

low rate of serious adverse events with use of phentermine/topiramate (3.4% for low-dose and 3.7% for

high-dose) compared to placebo (4.2%).[103] The harms slightly outweighed the benefits. Evidence on

other medications was not found and therefore not reviewed.

As this is a _Reviewed, New-added_ recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence

related to this recommendation identified in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline

update.[ 103] The confidence in the quality of the evidence was low due to risk of bias concerns and the

small effect size. The harms slightly outweigh the benefits; there were gastrointestinal (GI) and

musculoskeletal side effects with orlistat and relatively modest benefits. There is large variation in patient

preferences regarding this medication because of the side effects. Patients may not want to take the

medication, and there is the potential for taking the medication for life. Therefore, the Work Group

decided upon a “Neither for nor against” recommendation.

#### Recommendation

17. For the treatment of hypertension, there is insufficient evidence to suggest for or against bariatric
    surgery for patients with obesity and hypertension.
    **(Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added)**

#### Discussion

The Work Group also looked at the evidence for offering bariatric surgery for the treatment of HTN for

patients with obesity and HTN. There was insufficient evidence in the studies reviewed by the Work Group

to recommend for or against offering bariatric surgery for the treatment of HTN.

The evidence for this recommendation was based on one SR [105] and one RCT.[104] In the RCT, by

Schiavon et al. (2018), patients with a BMI of 30 to 39.9 kg/m^2 were followed for 12 months after surgical


intervention and demonstrated a greater reduction in anti-hypertensive medication usage as compared to

patients treated with medications (from an average of three medications to zero to one). There were

adverse events reported when patients were medically or surgically treated.[104] Schiavon et al. (2018)

reported no differences in reduction of SBP and DBP between medical or surgical treatment groups.[104]

The SR by Yan et al. (2016) followed the patients receiving medical treatment or bariatric surgery for 12 to

60 months; the highest BMI was 43 kg/m^2 .[ 105] Yan et al. (2016) found only a statistically significant

decrease in SBP in the bariatric surgery treatment group.[105] The confidence of the quality of the

evidence is very low, and benefits and harms were balanced.

As this is a _Reviewed, New-added_ , the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this

recommendation identified in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update.[ 104,105]

The confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. The benefit and harms of bariatric surgery are

balanced. The potential for positive outcomes was balanced with the risk of adverse events from surgery.

There was large variation in the patient values and preferences regarding whether to have the surgery or

avoiding surgery and committing to a lifestyle change. Not everyone would or should accept surgery as an

intervention due to personal values and the inherent risks of any surgery, including bariatric surgery. The

necessary medications and cost of surgery also need to be considered. Most of the evidence focused on

patients with comorbid HTN and diabetes. Based on all these considerations, the Work Group determined

that there was insufficient evidence for or against recommending bariatric surgery to treat HTN.

#### b. Exercise/Physical Activity

#### Recommendation

18. We suggest offering individual or group-based exercise for the treatment of hypertension to
    reduce blood pressure.
    **(Weak for | Reviewed, Amended)**

#### Discussion

The evidence in support of this recommendation was strongest for combined aerobic and resistance

exercise interventions and for group/team-based sports. Other interventions reviewed included aerobic

dance training, water-based exercise, yoga, traditional Chinese exercises such as Tai Chi and Qigong, and

digital interventions to reduce sedentary time.

Aerobic and resistance exercise interventions, both individually and in combination, have been shown to

reduce blood pressure. Herrod et al. (2018) conducted an SR of RCTs comparing non-pharmacologic

strategies to non-intervention controls.[111] The included studies had mean participant ages of at least 65;

intervention duration ranged from four weeks to one year. The researchers found statistically significant

improvements favoring each type of exercise intervention for both SBP and DBP. MDs in SBP and DBP for

combined aerobic/resistance exercise versus control were -5.9 mm Hg and -3.5 mm Hg, respectively. A

2016 meta-analysis by Corso et al. (2016) also examined the efficacy of combining aerobic and resistance

exercise interventions of similar duration for blood pressure reduction in slightly younger (mean age across

studies 56 years) prehypertensive adults.[112] Statistically significant reductions of -3.2 mm Hg (SBP) and -

2.5 mm Hg (DBP) were seen for concurrent aerobic and resistance training versus control.


Herrod et al. (2018) also reported data favoring separate aerobic, resistance, and isometric exercise

interventions over control.[111] MDs in SBP and DBP for aerobic exercise versus control were -5.1 mm Hg

and -2.2 mm Hg, respectively, while MDs in SBP and DBP for resistance exercise versus control were -5.5

mm Hg and -2.0 mm Hg, respectively. Only two studies included in the SR looked at isometric exercise

versus control; MDs of -9.1 mm Hg (SBP) and -3.0 mm Hg (DBP) were reported. Additional data on aerobic

exercise comes from a 2016 RCT comparing aerobic dance training to non-exercise controls in participants

on two antihypertensive agents.[113] Statistically significant differences in both SBP and DBP favored

dance training. A larger proportion of participants in the dance group were able to reduce their number of

blood pressure medications; however, control participants were older and had a higher BMI at baseline.

Recreational group sports may offer similar blood pressure reductions as combination aerobic/resistance

exercise, as well as improving other cardiovascular risk factors. Bellissimo et al. (2018) conducted an SR

and meta-analysis to estimate the pooled effects of community-based, recreational-level group sports on

cardiometabolic risk factors and fitness parameters in adults.[114] Included trials compared group sports

interventions against exercise and/or non-exercise controls; the majority used soccer as the group sports

intervention. Intervention groups averaged 134 min/week of physical activity; the average intervention

duration was roughly six months. Statistically significant differences favored recreational group sports for

both SBP (MD - 5.7 mm Hg) and DBP (MD - 3.4 mm Hg). Improvements in total cholesterol, low-density

lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and BMI were also seen with intervention groups; statistically significant

differences favored recreational group sports.

An SR by Reichert et al. (2018) examined the blood pressure effects of aquatic-based exercise versus land

training or non-exercise controls in adults and elderly individuals.[115] Aquatic interventions included

aerobic, resistance, or combined aerobic/resistance training, but were limited to exercise performed in an

upright position due to potentially beneficial physiological changes associated with hydrostatic pressure

from immersion. Improvements in blood pressure for aquatic-based exercise versus control reached

statistical significance only with sensitivity analyses for individuals with HTN (SBP and DBP) or for

individuals with prehypertension (DBP only).

Evidence reviewed did not suggest meaningful differences between higher and lower intensities of

exercise or digital interventions to reduce sedentary time versus control. The strength of evidence

reviewed for yoga and traditional Chinese exercise was rated low or very low quality and showed either no

benefit for intervention versus control or inconsistent findings for critical outcomes.[116- 119 ]

As this is a _Reviewed, Amended_ recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence

related to this recommendation identified in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline

update.[ 111- 119 ] Quality of the evidence reviewed was affected by the inherent difficulty of blinding

participants to exercise interventions. Some studies also lacked blinding (or reporting of blinding) of

assessors to interventions or had meaningful differences in baseline characteristic between intervention

groups. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence for exercise overall is low, but varied

across types of interventions, with the strongest evidence (moderate quality) found for combined

aerobic/resistance exercise and for recreational group sports.

Patient preferences regarding exercise may vary considerably; some may dislike exercise, while others may

value it as a means to potentially limit pill burden. Preferences for different types of exercise may also


vary. Patients who dislike traditional exercise may be more likely to engage in group sports due to social or

competitive aspects. The benefits of exercise outweigh the harms, particularly given the wide range of

other health parameters positively affected by physical activity.

#### Recommendation

19. We recommend a target for aerobic exercise of at least 120 minutes per week for reduction in
    blood pressure.
    **(Strong for | Not Reviewed, Amended)**

#### Discussion

As this is a _Not Reviewed, Amended_ recommendation, the Work Group did not systematically review new

evidence related to this recommendation. Two meta-analyses of RCTs studying the effects of aerobic

exercise on blood pressure were reviewed during the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG update and provide evidence

that the quantity of aerobic exercise influences its efficacy in blood pressure reduction.[120, 121 ] Whelton

et al. (2002) showed statistically significant improvements in blood pressure for interventions involving at

least 120 minutes/week of aerobic exercise; magnitude of effect was clinically meaningful for SBP and

DBP.[121] Kelley et al. (2001) also showed statistically significant improvements in blood pressure;

furthermore, a meta-regression showed that increased minutes of exercise per session were associated

with greater reductions in blood pressure.[120] Based on the assessment of the quality of the evidence put

forth in the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG,[ 120, 121 ] the Work Group determined the confidence in the quality of

evidence is moderate for SBP and low for DBP. Benefits clearly outweigh the harms, although some

patients may dislike, or have limited ability to, exercise.

#### c. Dietary Modifications

#### Recommendation

20. We recommend a dietitian-led Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet for the treatment or
    prevention of hypertension for patients with hypertension or interested patients with other
    cardiovascular risk factors.
    **(Strong for | Not Reviewed, Amended)**

#### Discussion

Clinical trials on supplements frequently produce different or even opposite results than those expected

based on epidemiologic data showing associations between food constituents and health outcomes. As

individuals consume whole foods rather than isolated nutrients, it is more useful to confirm that a

pattern of whole foods confers benefit, rather than that a micro/macronutrient is beneficial dependent

on context.

Fiber and various micronutrients such as potassium, magnesium, and calcium are thought to improve

blood pressure based on epidemiologic data. The DASH trial represents the first major clinical trial to test a

dietary pattern for the prevention and/or management of HTN. The DASH trial emphasized inclusion of

these nutrients via commonly consumed foods rather than supplements.[122] This approach allows for the

detection of potential additive and/or synergistic effects of these nutrients which might individually be too

small to detect. The DASH diet has been shown to reduce SBP and DBP in both hypertensive and

normotensive adults, whether at dietary sodium intakes similar to the average daily consumption [123] or


in combination with varying degrees of sodium restriction.[122] Combining the DASH diet with sodium

restriction consistently produces larger decreases in blood pressure than either intervention alone across

diverse subgroups.[124]

As this is a _Not Reviewed, Amended_ recommendation, the Work Group did not systematically review new

evidence related to this recommendation. However, confidence in the quality of the evidence

systematically reviewed for the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG is high.[122-124] Benefits outweigh harms, though

patient preferences regarding dietary modification may vary. Some patients may be resistant to changing

eating patterns or face geographical or financial barriers to accessing certain types of healthy foods. Others

may have high levels of motivation to improve diet quality in an effort to reduce pill burden. Patient focus

group participants indicated that initial referral to a dietitian is common but expressed the desire for

spouses/caregivers to be included in nutrition interventions when possible. The current guideline continues

to recommend the DASH diet based on the existing body of evidence to support its use in lowering blood

pressure.

#### Recommendation

```
21.In patients with hypertension, we recommend that sodium intake be limited to no more than
2,3 00 mg/day (100 mmol/day), with referral to a dietitian or other support as appropriate.
(Strong for | Not Reviewed, Not Changed)
```
#### Discussion

Many national and international organizations recommend reducing sodium intake for the prevention and

management of HTN, with the ultimate goal of reducing associated morbidity and mortality. New evidence

was not reviewed as part of this CPG update; evidence reviewed during the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG update

is summarized below.

There is a strong body of evidence from animal studies and human observational and experimental studies

noting a dose-dependent relationship between dietary sodium intake and blood pressure in both

normotensive and hypertensive individuals, though there is known variation in “salt sensitivity” both

within and across populations.

It should be noted that recommendations for dietary sodium reduction to reduce cardiovascular risk

generally rely on surrogate markers (e.g., blood pressure) rather than clinical outcomes. The current

guideline recommends a reduction to 2300 mg/day. There is strong clinical evidence from the DASH

sodium trial that a reduction from 3400 mg (average daily intake of U.S. adults) to 2300 mg (the previously

defined tolerable upper intake level [UL] [125])^12 improves blood pressure in the short term.[126] Limited

observational research suggests that CVD event rates also decrease with reductions in sodium intake

down to 2300 mg.[127]

Two relevant RCTs addressing blood pressure and/or mortality outcomes for reducing sodium intake were

reviewed during the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG update. The Trials of Hypertension Prevention Phase II (TOHP II)

(^12) There is no longer a defined UL for sodium, as there is no toxicological indicator specific to excessive sodium intake. The 2 019
Dietary Reference Intakes now include a new category, the Chronic Disease Risk Reduction Intake (CDRR), or intake above
which intake reduction is expected to reduce chronic disease risk in an apparently healthy population. The value of the new
CDRR for adults (2300 mg) is the same as the previous UL for sodium.


study compared counseling on sodium reduction to usual care in overweight adults.[128] The intervention

group achieved greater mean net decreases in SBP and DBP at both 18 and 36 months. The effect was

statistically significant when compared with controls for SBP at both times and for DBP at 18 months only.

Shea et al. (2011) presented mortality outcome data from a post-hoc analysis of the Trial of Non-

pharmacologic Interventions in the Elderly (TONE).[129] Despite the TONE trial achieving clinically and

statistically significant improvements in blood pressure,[110] no change in all-cause mortality was found

for the intervention group when compared to usual care. [129]

Both TOHP II and TONE were lifestyle interventions in free-living cohorts rather than controlled feeding

trials. Thus, the low percentage of intervention group participants who met the studies’ goal of <80

mmol/day (1840 mg) average sodium intake (21% in TOHP II, roughly 40% in TONE) represents the

inherent difficulty of l ifestyle modification compounded by the ubiquity of s odium in the present U.S. food

supply. The studies support reducing sodium intake as a means to lower blood pressure, but do not j ustify

a lower goal than 2300 mg or confirm that clinical outcomes are improved. It is possible that an effect on

mortality would have been detected had TONE intervention participants been more successful in lowering

sodium intake.

Several organizations recommend or suggest lower targets for daily sodium intake. The 2017 ACC/AHA

CPG recommends sodium reduction for adults with elevated blood pressure and lists <1500 mg as an

“optimal goal.”[4] The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends daily sodium intake

<2300 mg for adults, but note that t hose with HTN or prehypertension may benefit from further reduction

to 15 00 mg.[130]

The average daily sodium intake in the U.S. is over 3400 mg/day excluding table salt, well above this

guideline’s recommendation of 2300 mg/day.[131] Disagreement regarding the exact cut-point at which

risks outweigh benefits should not distract from a unified public health message that a reduction in sodium

intake from current levels is desirable.

As this is a _Not Reviewed, Not Changed_ recommendation, the Work Group did not systematically review

new evidence related to this recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of t he evidence

remains high based on evidence reviewed during the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG update.[126, 128 ,129] The

benefits of reducing daily dietary sodium intake to 2300 mg outweigh the harms. As dietary sodium

recommendations rely heavily on research on surrogate markers, additional research is warranted to

confirm that reducing blood pressure via reducing sodium intake has the predicted effect on morbidity and

mortality. Future research is also needed to determine the efficacy and safety of lower sodium targets.

Since the majority of s odium consumed by Americans comes from processed and prepared foods (versus

added table salt), recommended intake levels would be attained most feasibly with changes to the food

supply i n addition to individual dietary modification. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has

solicited comments on, but has not yet released, voluntary sodium reduction targets for food

manufacturers and restaurants. Patients’ desire and ability to reduce sodium intake may vary; some may

find low sodium diets unpalatable, and others, such as deployed military, may have limited access to

fresh/unprocessed foods. Referral to a dietitian can help interested patients incorporate this

recommendation into the broader context of a healthful diet. Per the patient focus group, inclusion of

spouses/caregivers in nutrition interventions may provide additional benefit, as they may be responsible

for household food shopping and/or preparation.


#### Recommendation

22. In patients with additional cardiovascular risk factors, such as dyslipidemia, we suggest considering
    a dietitian-led Mediterranean Diet as an alternative to the Dietary Approaches to Stop
    Hypertension Diet.
    **(Weak for | Not Reviewed, Not Changed)**

#### Discussion

Epidemiologic data has long suggested a cardio-protective effect of a Mediterranean-style diet. Despite

known variation in the cuisine of Mediterranean countries, certain characteristic features are commonly

used to describe a traditional Mediterranean diet: high intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts, unrefined grains,

and olive oil; moderate intake of fish and poultry; low or moderate intake of wine; and low intake of red

meat, processed meat, dairy, and sweets. New evidence was not reviewed as part of the current CPG

update. Evidence reviewed during the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG update is summarized below.

Toledo et al. evaluated the effects of a Mediterranean diet on blood pressure in the PREDIMED

(PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea) trial in Spain, which included a large cohort of men and women at

high cardiovascular risk.[132] The two intervention groups received individual and group education on an

energy-unrestricted Mediterranean diet from registered dietitians, as well as regular supplies of either

extra-virgin olive oil or mixed nuts. The control group received a similar format of education on a low-fat

diet. Statistically significant improvements in DBP, but not SBP, were found for both intervention groups

when compared to controls at four years.[132] Furthermore, the two groups randomized to the

Mediterranean diet experienced a significant 28-30% reduction in major cardiovascular events (MI, stroke,

or death from cardiovascular causes).[133]

The PREDIMED trial was subsequently retracted and republished in 2018 due to issues with the

randomization process.[134] One site enrolled household members without randomization. Another

assigned entire clinics to an intervention group rather than individual participants. A third site reported

inconsistent use of randomization tables. In the republished paper, data was reanalyzed to account for

correlations within families or clinics. The authors also reported a reanalysis of data after exclusion of

participants known or suspected to have been improperly randomized. Reported results were similar after

these corrections.

As this is a _Not Reviewed, Not Changed_ recommendation, the Work Group did not systematically review

new evidence related to this recommendation as part of this guideline update. Confidence in the quality

of evidence is low based on evidence put forth in the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG.[ 132 ] I ssues with the

randomization process of the PREDIMED trial were reported, but the corrected results were similar to

those initially published.[134] Additional research is warranted to confirm these results, as well as to

test the Mediterranean diet in RCTs of more diverse populations and against controls with more

dissimilar baseline characteristics and intervention dietary patterns. Based on the available evidence,

the benefits of this intervention outweigh the harms. Patient preferences vary regarding dietary

modification; interested patients may prefer one dietary pattern over another. A Mediterranean-style

dietary pattern may be beneficial to patients with HTN. It presents a viable alternative to the DASH diet

for those who find lower fat diets unpalatable, have additional cardiovascular risk factors, or otherwise


prefer the Mediterranean dietary pattern. Referral to a registered dietitian, when available, may help

patients achieve the desired changes.

### D. Pharmacological Treatment

#### a. For Hypertension

#### Recommendation

23. We recommend offering a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker, or either an
    angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker as primary
    pharmacologic therapy for hypertension for reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes.
    **(Strong for | Reviewed, New-replaced)**

#### Discussion

The effects of the various antihypertensive drug classes on reducing composite cardiovascular outcomes,

and not just differences in blood pressure lowering effect, were the focus for the recommendation. The SR

and meta-analysis of 50 RCTs by Thomopoulos et al. (2015) was the key body of evidence reviewed to

recommend these four main drug classes as initial therapy for HTN.[ 135] Head-to-head comparisons of

different antihypertensive drug classes were made for the critical and important outcomes. The

components of the critical outcome from the SR included the composite of fatal or nonfatal stroke and

CHD events (coronary death and nonfatal MI), both with and without hospitalizations for heart failure. In

patients with HTN, the SR found that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) were equivalent to

angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs); ACEIs were equivalent to thiazide-type diuretics; and calcium

channel blockers (CCBs) were equivalent to thiazide-type diuretics for composite cardiovascular outcomes.

No significant differences in the critical outcome were found for the comparisons of ACEIs and CCBs or

ARBs and CCBs. This does not imply equivalency, only that a conclusion could not be determined. No

critical outcomes were noted for ARBs versus thiazide-type diuretics.[ 135]

The Work Group did not make a formal recommendation for other outcomes such as stroke or heart

failure reduction alone. However, there were an extensive number of comparisons that addressed other

outcomes. Notable findings were that thiazide-type diuretics were superior to the other drug classes for

preventing CHF outcomes, CCBs were superior to the other drug classes for reducing all-cause mortality,

and CCBs were inferior to other drug classes at preventing CHF outcomes.[ 135] ACEIs and ARBs are not

used concomitantly, due to well-recognized safety risks, as discussed in Recommendation 26.

Although the evidence was not supportive of a recommendation, providers can consider beta blockers as

an alternative to the four main antihypertensive classes for patients with compelling indications, including

those with underlying CAD, following MI, and in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Patients who

are intolerant to the four main antihypertensive drug classes may also consider a beta blocker. The SR

found beta blockers were equivalent to ARBs for the composite cardiovascular outcomes and reported no

significant difference between beta blockers and CCBs or thiazide-type diuretics. There were no critical

outcomes reported for beta blockers compared to ACEIs. Some important outcomes showed beta blockers

were inferior to the other drugs classes, particularly for stroke reduction.[ 135] Beta blockers are not

recommended as initial antihypertensive therapy, as the evidence is mixed as to whether there is a clear

benefit in reducing cardiovascular events.


Thomopoulos et al. (2015) did not evaluate differences in adverse events.[ 135] However, the Work Group

determined that the benefits of the reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes outweighed the

harms, including both the AEs associated with pharmacologic therapy (e.g., orthostatic hypotension,

increases in serum creatinine, hyperkalemia, other metabolic concerns) and the alternative of not

receiving drug treatment.

Although the four main drug classes for initial therapy were supported by the evidence base, there is

still some variation, as individual patients may show differences in personal choices, including tablet

burden and frequency of medication administration. Additionally, patient-to-patient variation in

tolerability of AEs can be a factor when choosing a particular antihypertensive drug class. This variability

was also supported by the patient focus group, during which some of the patients indicated that

providers focused on pharmacological therapies, rather than providing information and education on

non-pharmacologic treatments.

An important implication in terms of resource use is cost. Drug copayments for VA and TRICARE

beneficiaries vary depending on factors such as dispensing venue (e.g., military treatment facilities [MTF]

versus mail order) and whether a generic versus branded formulation is dispensed. Cost may be less of an

issue for active duty personnel, who receive their medications at no cost.

The Work Group agreed on a “Strong for” recommendation due to the robust and extensive body of

evidence from RCTs, meta-analyses, and SRs supporting use of the four main antihypertensive drug

classes.[ 135] This is considered a _Reviewed, New-replaced_ recommendation, as new evidence from the

SR focused on composite cardiovascular outcomes, in contrast to the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG

recommendation for which the primary literature was evaluated to recommend thiazide-type diuretics

as first-line.

The confidence in the quality of evidence was moderate, as the authors of the SR adjusted outcomes so

that the blood pressure reductions in each drug class were similar.[135] This led to the conclusion that

antihypertensive drugs from the same classes have the same blood pressure lowering effect, which may or

may not be true.

Thomopoulos et al. (2015) did not include the same individual components of the critical outcome in the

SR as the guideline-defined composite cardiovascular outcome (which was comprised of cardiovascular

and all-cause mortality, stroke, CHF, kidney function, safety and blood-pressure lowering).[135] However,

overall, the consensus of the Work Group was that the critical outcome results supported that the four

antihypertensive drug classes produced similar effects on reducing composite cardiovascular events.

#### Recommendation

24. In African American patients with hypertension, we recommend against using an angiotensin-
    converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker as monotherapy.
    **(Strong against | Not Reviewed, Not Changed)**

#### Discussion

In addition to being recommended as primary pharmacologic therapy for HTN for reduction in composite

cardiovascular outcomes in this CPG (see Recommendation 23), a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB are


appropriate initial choices for African Americans with HTN.[ 136] Of the 33,357 participants in the

Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack (ALLHAT) trial, 35% were African

American.[ 137] A subgroup analysis of this patient population found that the ACEI (lisinopril) was less

ef fective in lowering blood pressure than the thiazide-type diuretic (chlorthalidone) or the long-acting

dihydropyridine (LA DHP) CCB (amlodipine).[136] Although there was no significant difference between an

ACEI or thiazide-type diuretic in the primary outcome of combined fatal CHD or nonfatal MI, the subgroup

analysis of African American patients found that those participants randomized to the ACEI versus the

thiazide-type diuretic were at a 40% greater risk of stroke, 30% greater risk of heart failure, 19% greater

risk of CVD, and 15% greater risk of combined CHD.[136] There was no difference in major CVD outcomes

between the thiazide-type diuretic and the LA DHP CCB in the subgroup of African American patients,

other than a higher incidence of heart failure with the CCB.[136] The ALLHAT study also found that African

American patients randomized to the LA DHP CCB (amlodipine) had greater adherence to treatment and

required fewer medications to reach the blood pressure goal than those randomly assigned to the ACEI

(lisinopril).[138] Additionally, the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction (LIFE) in Hypertension

study reported that African Americans prescribed a beta-blocker (atenolol) had better cardiovascular

outcomes than those prescribed an ARB (losartan).[139]

In the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK), ACEIs were found to be more

effective than beta-blockers or LA DHP CCBs in slowing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline among

African American patients with proteinuria.[140] The AASK trial would suggest that African Americans with

CKD should be placed on an ACEI, but the ALLHAT study reported that chlorthalidone was superior to

lisinopril for CVD outcomes in African Americans.[141] Therefore, for African American patients with CKD

on monotherapy with an ACEI or an ARB, the addition of a thiazide-type diuretic would be appropriate as

additional therapy to augment the cardiovascular protection of diuretics to the kidney protection of ACEIs

or ARBs. Providers may refer to the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic

Kidney Disease^13 for further discussion of use of an ACEI or ARB in patients with CKD.

In addition, the potential for increased risk of AEs with blood pressure medication was a concern noted

among the participants in the patient focus group. Although not included in the previous evidence review,

the Work Group noted the potential for harm with an ACEI in African American patients due to an

increased risk for angioedema reported to be up to five times greater than in white patients. Of the

patients randomized to an ACEI in ALLHAT, angioedema was reported as a serious adverse event more

frequently in the subgroup of African American patients (0.72%) compared to non-African American

patients (0.31%), and more frequently than African American patients receiving treatment with a thiazide-

type diuretic (0.04%) or a LA DHP CCB (0.06%).[136] Per FDA product information, angioedema has been

reported rarely in patients treated with an ARB. Additional research is needed to determine the risk in

African American patients and/or patients who have previously experienced angioedema while on an ACEI.

Additional considerations include potential compelling indications for use of an ACEI or ARB in patients

with HTN and comorbidities.

As this is a _Not Reviewed, Not Changed_ recommendation, the Work Group did not systematically review

evidence related to this recommendation. Based on the evidence review from the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG,

(^13) See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Disease. Available at:
https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/cd/ckd/index.asp


the Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence is high.[136-141] Other considerations

regarding this recommendation include the potential for harm (from a rare but serious adverse event) as

well as reduced benefit in this patient population (i.e., reduced outcome benefit and less blood pressure

reduction compared to alternative treatments). Patient values and preferences were considered to be

similar. Thus, the Work Group decided to carry forward the “Strong for” recommendation against use of

an ACEI or ARB as monotherapy in African American patients with HTN. It is appropriate to add an ACEI or

ARB to a thiazide-type diuretic and/or a CCB for this population.

#### Recommendation

25. In hypertensive patients 65 years and over, we suggest a thiazide-type diuretic for reduction in
    composite cardiovascular outcomes.
    **(Weak for | Reviewed, New-added)**

#### Discussion

In hypertensive patients over the age of 65, treatment with a thiazide-type diuretic compared to other

treatment options has been shown to reduce a composite cardiovascular outcome which included heart

failure and stroke.[142] In this same meta-analysis, beta-blockers performed worse than all other

therapies and CCBs, ACEIs, and ARBs had no significant difference in the composite outcome for patients

over the age of 65 compared to other therapies. It is important to note that the age of 65 is an arbitrary

cut-off that was used in this single meta-analysis. Individual trials have used various age cut-offs for

enrollment. Furthermore, this meta-analysis reported similar outcomes with an age cut-off of 60, as

compared to 65. Large RCTs are consistent with this recommendation, specifically ALLHAT which is

especially pertinent to VA/DoD providers due to the more than 7,000 Veterans included in the study.[ 137]

Of note, ALLHAT enrolled patients age 55 and over and demonstrated improved CVD outcomes with

chlorthalidone compared to amlodipine or lisinopril. Harms of thiazide-type diuretics versus other

therapies were considered, but a meta-analysis of adverse events did not demonstrate any significant

difference between thiazide-type diuretics and other therapies.[142] In general, the evidence supports the

use of thiazide-type diuretics in older patients with HTN over other classes of medication.

While there is strong evidence that thiazide-type diuretics in general reduce a composite cardiovascular

outcome, there is significant variability between agents in the thiazide-type diuretic class. The strongest

trial evidence for improved CVD outcomes with thiazide-type diuretics involves chlorthalidone and

indapamide, from ALLHAT and the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET), respectively.[ 137, 143 ] In

Avoiding Cardiovascular Events in Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension

(ACCOMPLISH), ACEI/CCB combination was favored over an ACEI/thiazide-type diuretic combination.[144]

The dose and type of the thiazide-type diuretic in ACCOMPLISH (hydrochlorothiazide [HCTZ] 12.5-25

mg/day) was lower than equipotent doses of chlorthalidone or indapamide. For initial or add-on treatment

of HTN, chlorthalidone and indapamide result in greater decreases of blood pressure compared to low

doses (12.5-25 mg/day) of HCTZ. For these reasons, chlorthalidone or indapamide is preferred over HCTZ

when choosing a thiazide-type diuretic. Patient preferences may vary based on the requirement for

laboratory monitoring with thiazide-type medications.

As this is a _Reviewed, New-added_ recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence

related to this recommendation.[137,142-144] The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the


evidence is moderate. The body of evidence had some limitations including an assumption of class effect

between all thiazide-type diuretics, inconsistent results across different composite outcomes, and an

age cut-off that did not match the primary study evidence.[137,142-144] Other considerations regarding

this recommendation included the benefits, primarily in the composite cardiovascular outcome,

outweighing the potential harm of adverse events, which was insignificant compared to other therapies.

Patient values and preferences were somewhat varied. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a “Weak

for” recommendation.

More research is needed into the comparative effectiveness of different medications in the thiazide-type

diuretic class.

#### Recommendation

26. We recommend against more than one of the following three drug classes together in the same
    patient: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or direct renin
    inhibitors.
    **(Strong against | Not Reviewed, Not Changed)**

#### Discussion

Despite the potential for additional blood pressure reduction with combination therapy of agents that act

at the renin-angiotensin system (ACEIs, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitors [DRIs]), data from clinical trials

have reported an increased risk for harm (including hypotensive symptoms, kidney dysfunction or acute

kidney injury events, or hyperkalemia) without long-term cardiovascular or kidney outcome benefit in

patients treated with combination therapy with any two of these three classes compared to

monotherapy.[ 145-147] Although these trials primarily studied high-risk patients (those with at least one

of the following conditions: vascular disease, diabetes, CKD, or diabetic nephropathy), the majority of

patients either had a diagnosis of HTN or were being treated with antihypertensive medications.[ 145- 147 ]

As this is a _Not Reviewed, Not Changed_ recommendation, the Work Group did not systematically review

evidence related to this recommendation. Based on the evidence reviewed during the 2014 VA/DoD HTN

CPG update, the Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate.[ 147] Two

additional studies that were not part of the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG evidence review, but were included in

the previous discussion, provide support for the lack of benefit and potential harm with combination

therapy.[145,146] Other considerations regarding this recommendation include the potential harm of

adverse events, which was significant, and lack of outcome benefit, outweighing the minimal potential

benefit of additional blood pressure reduction. Patient values and preferences were considered to be

similar. The Work Group decided to carry forward the “Strong against” recommendation against use of

combination therapy with an ACEI, ARB, or DRI, so as to inform providers of the rationale against this

practice.

#### Recommendation

27. For the treatment of hypertension, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against
    initiating combination therapy over initiating monotherapy with the sequential addition of
    another medication.
    **(Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-replaced)**


#### Discussion

Combination therapy for treating HTN is common. The ACCOMPLISH study confirmed that combination

therapy is safe and effective.[144] Patients in ALLHAT often utilized combination therapy,[137] with only

26% of participants reaching goal blood pressure (<140/90 mm Hg) with monotherapy.[148] Generally

speaking, larger reductions of blood pressure (e.g., 20/10 mm Hg or more) often require at least two

medications to achieve blood pressure control, and initiating therapy with two drugs is effective and well

tolerated, apart from a slight increase in dizziness incidence for some combination dosing, in most

patients.[149]

However, evidence is lacking on the effect of various treatment approaches on important primary

outcomes (e.g., mortality, cardiovascular events, stroke). Specifically, additional studies are needed on

initiating therapy with one drug and sequentially titrating agents compared to starting two drugs

simultaneously and titrating as necessary. The systematic evidence review conducted for this CPG update

did not identify any studies that met inclusion criteria. From a practical perspective, providers and

patients—depending on their preferences as well as a patient’s comorbid conditions and the anticipated

magnitude of blood pressure lowering—may wish to consider combination therapy when selecting initial

therapy. Initial combination therapy may reduce the number of titrations and visits to achieve blood

pressure goal. Patients with a compelling indication for more than one class of antihypertensive agent may

benefit from initial combination therapy, as well. Additionally, combination pills, when available, may

reduce medication co-payments for some patients. Whether using sequential or initial combination

therapy, providers should attempt to achieve dosing ranges that have been found to impact important

clinical outcomes.

As this is a _Reviewed, New-replaced_ recommendation, the Work Group systematically searched for

evidence related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline

update; however, no evidence met inclusion criteria. Therefore, this recommendation is based on

evidence cited in the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG.[137, 144 ,149] The Work Group determined there is some

variation in patient values and preferences as some patients may prefer reducing the number of pills but

fixed-dose combination therapy may not always be available (e.g., in the desired drug combination or

strength) or prescribed.

#### b. For Resistant Hypertension

#### Recommendation

28. For patients with resistant hypertension (defined as those who are not adequately controlled with
    maximally tolerated dose of triple therapy [i.e., a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blockers,
    and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker]), we suggest
    adding spironolactone in those patients without contraindications.
    **(Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced)**

#### Discussion

The mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) spironolactone more effectively reduced SBP and DBP

compared to placebo when added as the fourth agent to the treatment regimen of patients with resistant

HTN (RHT).[150,151] In patients with a history of hyperkalemia and diminished renal function,

spironolactone should be used cautiously and with frequent monitoring of potassium and renal function in


RHT patients, and should be avoided altogether in patients with eGFR less than 30 ml/min/1.73M^2 or a

serum potassium greater than 5.0 mEq/L. Since spironolactone has both antiandrogenic and endocrine

effects, it should also be used cautiously in patients with menstrual irregularities, breast pain or

gynecomastia.

Two SRs that included five RCTs of 662 patients with RHT and four RCTs of 553 patients with RHT,

respectively, compared spironolactone to placebo or to ramipril.[150,151] Compared to placebo,

spironolactone reduced office SBP/DBP by an average of 15.73/6.21 mm Hg and 24-hour ambulatory or

home SBP/DBP by 8.70/4.12 mm Hg.[ 150] More limited studies of another MRA, eplerenone,[152] and

an epithelial sodium channel blocker, amiloride,[153] suggest that they have qualitatively similar effects

on blood pressure as spironolactone in patients with RHT. Compared with clonidine or spironolactone,

the addition of other antihypertensive drugs ( notably candesartan, doxazosin, bisoprolol, ramipril,

atenolol, or alpha methyldopa) to the three-drug regimen of patients with RHT were less effective in

reducing blood pressure.[ 150,154] It should be noted, however, that there are no studies which directly

compare either amiloride or eplerenone with spironolactone in patients with RHT. From a safety

perspective, spironolactone, eplerenone, and amiloride all consistently resulted in a modest increase in

serum potassium.

The longest period of evaluation of the effect of spironolactone, another antihypertensive drug, or placebo

on blood pressure in these RCTs was 24 weeks. Thus, it was not possible to determine the effect of the

drugs on cardiovascular outcomes. However, one RCT, the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart

Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist trial (TOPCAT), included patients who met the criteria for

RHT.[ 155] A subset of 403 of the study participants from the Americas (U.S., Canada, Argentina, and Brazil)

had RHT; 1,361 patients without RHT served as the comparator group. Patients were treated for an

average of 2.92 years with either spironolactone or placebo in addition to their three-drug therapy. SBP in

the spironolactone group was lower than in the placebo group at four weeks and remained significantly

lower for at least eight months. The significantly greater reduction in the primary endpoint in

spironolactone- versus placebo-treated patients was comparable in those with and without RHT.

The evidence on which this recommendation is made is derived from three SRs and two independent RCTs

that were not included in the SRs.[150-152, 154 ,155] A third open-label study documented the blood

pressure lowering effect of amiloride in a subset of 146 RHT patients who had already been treated with

spironolactone, placebo, bisoprolol, or doxazosin in the Pathway-2 RCT.[153] The results of this substudy

were not included in the three SRs since it was published later. The Work Group did not consider this

substudy in its development of the recommendation or determination of the confidence in the quality of

the evidence. Among the five RCTs included in the SR by Liu et al. ( 2017 ) spironolactone consistently

lowered office and ambulatory or home SBP and DBP in the pooled analysis.[150] In this analysis,

spironolactone also lowered SBP by 4.5 mm Hg compared to atenolol, candesartan, or alpha methyldopa,

a statistically significant effect. The strength of evidence to support the efficacy of spironolactone to lower

both SBP and DBP compared to either placebo or other drugs previously listed was considered to be high

with a low risk of bias. Similar conclusions were reached after review of the SR by Wang et al. (2016).[ 151 ]

In contrast, the strength of the evidence represented by the 19 studies of 2,758 patients with RHT in the

SR by Makai et al. ( 2017) was very low.[152] Studies of both spironolactone and eplerenone (MRAs) were

combined for this analysis so it was impossible to determine if the efficacy of each was equivalent to the


other. Furthermore, the collective risk of bias among the studies was considered to be a serious limitation

even though 24-hour SBP and DBP were significantly reduced when assessed by ABPM but not by office

DBP. When Krieger et al. (2018) compared the effects of clonidine on office and 24-hour blood pressure

with those of low-dose spironolactone in patients with RHT with multiple comorbidities excluded, there

were no significant differences but there was considerable variability in the responses of the patients.[154]

Collectively, there was sufficient concern about either imprecision or risk of bias among the SRs and RCT

supporting the addition for adding spironolactone as the preferred fourth agent in patients with RHT still

not controlled on three drugs to make only a “Weak for” recommendation. Although of considerable

clinical interest, the findings that spironolactone reduced cardiovascular outcomes in the TOPCAT cohort

with preserved ejection fraction heart failure and RHT similarly to those without RHT was not considered

in the above assessment because of the serious limitations of the study design as well as serious

imprecision.[155] In addition, it is likely that this population of preselected patients with heart failure are

phenotypically different from other patients with RHT.

Before adding a fourth drug to the treatment regimen, medication adherence should be assessed and the

benefits of non-pharmacologic therapy should be reinforced in every patient who meets the criteria for

RHT. Because of the frequency with which medication non-adherence occurs in this population, the term

“apparent treatment resistant hypertension” has appeared in the literature with increasing frequency. If

addition of spironolactone is being considered, it should be remembered that spironolactone will interfere

with the tests that are ordered as part of the evaluation for hyperaldosteronism, a secondary form of HTN.

If a secondary HTN workup is planned, initiation of therapy with spironolactone should be delayed until

that workup is complete.

Drugs other than spironolactone may be more appropriate for the RHT patient who has a history of

hyperkalemia, has significantly impaired kidney function, sexual dysfunction, or has developed either

mastodynia or gynecomastia upon exposure to this drug in the past. A number of different drugs are

available for the RHT patient whose blood pressure remains uncontrolled.

As this is a _Reviewed, New-replaced_ recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the

evidence related to this recommendation. The following three SRs or meta-analyses [ 150- 152 ] and two

RCTs [154, 155 ] identified in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update were

evaluated in detail. The strengths and weakness of the data in this literature are summarized above. The

benefits of taking once-daily spironolactone outweighs the potential for AEs when the RHT patient is

chosen carefully and monitored closely as therapy is initiated.

Epidemiologically, patients who meet the criteria for RHT are at increased risk for fatal and non-fatal

cardiovascular events. Yet there are no outcome data to guide the clinical practitioner on which fourth-line

drug will have the greatest effect on cardiovascular events. Furthermore, little is known about the impact

of age, gender, and comorbidities like diabetes, CKD, CAD, or prior stroke on the response to specific

medications in patients with RHT.


## VIII. Research Priorities..........................................................................................................................

During the development of the 2020 VA/DoD HTN CPG, the Work Group identified numerous areas for

future research, including areas requiring stronger evidence to support current recommendations as well

as research exploring new areas to guide future CPGs.

### A. Automated Office Blood Pressure and Out-of -office Blood Pressure

Out-of -office blood pressure measurements were shown to be superior to routine office blood pressure

measurements in predicting cardiovascular events; therefore, future studies should focus on impact of

blood pressure management based on out-of -office blood pressure measurements on clinically relevant

outcomes in hypertensive individuals. Further research is also needed to evaluate whether patient-related

outcomes can be improved with management of HTN in the general population based on blood pressure

targets obtained with AOBP that is being increasingly recognized as equivalent to out-of -office blood

pressure. Additionally, variation in appropriate management for blood pressure variation by time of day

and season should be included in future studies to determine the clinical significance.

### B. Self-monitoring of Blood Pressure

Areas of research include the development of protocols allowing for self-management and self-adjustment

of antihypertensive medications by hypertensive individuals, based on home self-monitoring of blood

pressure and provider guidance. Furthermore, it is important to identify what specific hypertensive

populations (demographic characteristics and comorbidities) would benefit the most from self-monitoring

of blood pressure and what outcomes (blood pressure control, adherence, cardiovascular outcomes) may

be improved with self-monitoring of blood pressure.

### C. New Technology

Future research on application of new technology in management of HTN should include incorporation of

telemonitoring using smartphone applications and other technology to improve patients’ adherence to

medications and enable communication with healthcare providers to maximize access to treatment.

### D. Interdisciplinary Approaches

HTN treatment requires a complex approach combining prescription drug management, implementation

of a healthy lifestyle and diet, and monitoring of adherence to these interventions. Therefore, high quality

randomized trials are needed to evaluate cost-effectiveness and impact on patient-related clinical

outcomes of protocolized nurse-led and pharmacist-led antihypertensive medication titration programs,

and the role of registered dietitian-led interventions targeting healthy lifestyle changes and diet, and

adherence monitoring for improving blood pressure control and patient-centered outcomes.

### E. Diet and Exercise

Most of the evidence supports modest reduction in blood pressure with low sodium diets; however,

clinical trials are needed to evaluate whether long-term cardiovascular outcomes can be also affected by

low sodium diets, and whether it is the low sodium diet itself or low sodium intake as a part of an overall

healthy dietary pattern which leads to improved clinical end-points.


Despite general belief that a reduction in sedentary time results in lowering of blood pressure, there is a

paucity of clinical data about optimal duration, frequency and specific type(s) of exercise that would result

in improved patient outcomes. Clinical trials are required to address these research questions.

### F. Obesity and Hypertension

Growing rates of obesity call for additional research on blood pressure lowering as well as cardiovascular

benefits of weight loss interventions, including pharmacological therapy and bariatric surgery in obese

hypertensive individuals. Trials with long-term follow up are especially important to evaluate sustainability

and impact of weight-lowering interventions in patients with obesity and HTN.

### G. Pharmacotherapy

Combination antihypertensive therapy may allow for use of lower doses of individual agents and,

therefore, minimize adverse drug effects. However, clinical trials are needed to evaluate whether (and

which specific) combination of antihypertensive agents and at what doses are more effective than a

maximum-level dose of a single agent for blood pressure control and medication adherence. Clinical

trials should also focus on comparative effectiveness of (1) equivalent doses of chlorthalidone and

hydrochlorothiazide, and (2) newer antihypertensive agents, such as vasodilatory beta-blockers in

essential HTN.

Management of RHT is a rapidly expanding area and future studies with long-term follow-up that would

allow evaluation of clinical outcomes are needed to establish optimal fourth-line antihypertensive agents

in RHT and whether variations in patient characteristics may necessitate differential approaches to a

fourth-line agents for RHT.

### H. Screening for Asymptomatic Hypertension-mediated Target Organ Damage

Despite clinically sound concerns about target organ damage resulting from HTN and routine screening for

asymptomatic CVD and kidney disease that is done by many general practitioners, there is a paucity of

evidence to support this practice. Future studies are needed to evaluate cost effectiveness and clinical

impact of routine screening for asymptomatic target organ damage in hypertensive individuals. For

example, coronary artery calcification (CAC) score carries prognostic value in hypertensive patients.

However, additional research should address whether CAC scores can direct initiation of antihypertensive

## therapy and dictate individualization of blood pressure management and goals.


## Appendix A: Evidence Review Methodology

### A. Developing the Scope and Key Questions

The CPG Champions, along with the Work Group, were tasked with identifying KQs to guide the systematic

review of the literature on HTN. These questions, which were developed in consultation with the Lewin

Team, addressed clinical topics of the highest priority for the VA and DoD populations. The KQs follow the

population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework for evidence

questions, as established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Table A-1 provides a

brief overview of the PICOTS typology.

**Table A-1. PICOTS [156]**

```

```
Abbreviation: PICOTS: population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting

The Champions, Work Group, and evidence review team carried out several iterations of this process, each

time narrowing the scope of the CPG and the literature review by prioritizing the topics of interest. Due to

resource constraints, all developed KQs were not able to be included in the systematic evidence review.

Thus, the Champions and Work Group determined which questions were of highest priority, and those

were included in the review. Table A-2 contains the final set of KQs used to guide the SR for this CPG.

Once the KQs were finalized, the Work Group rated and prioritized the outcomes they had defined for

each KQ based on how important the Work Group judged each outcome to be. Rating outcomes by their

relative importance can help focus attention on those outcomes that are considered most important for

clinical decision making when making judgements regarding the overall quality of the evidence to support

a recommendation.[ 157 ]

Using GRADE methodology, the Work Group rated each outcome on a 1-9 scale (7-9, critical for decision

making; 4-6, important, but not critical, for decision making; and 1-3, of limited importance for decision

making). Critical and important outcomes were included in the evidence review (see Outcomes); however,

only outcomes judged to be critical were used to determine the overall quality of evidence (see Grading

Recommendations).

### B. Conducting the Systematic Review

Based on the decisions made by the Champions and Work Group members regarding the scope, the

KQs, and the PICOTS statements, the Lewin Team produced an SR protocol prior to conducting the

review. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Champions and Work Group members. It

described in detail the final set of KQs, the methodology to be used during the SR process, and the

inclusion/exclusion criteria to be applied to each potential study, including, but not limited to, study

type, sample size, and PICOTS criteria.

Extensive literature searches identified 16,492 citations potentially addressing the KQs of interest to this

evidence review. Of those, 11,050 were excluded upon title review for clearly not meeting inclusion

criteria (e.g., not pertinent to the topic, not published in English, published prior to study inclusion

publication date). Overall, 5,442 abstracts were reviewed with 4,723 of those being excluded for the

following reasons: not an SR or an accepted study design (see the General Criteria for Inclusion in

Systematic Review and Key Question Specific Criteria), did not address a KQ of interest to this review, did

not report on an outcome of interest, or published outside cut-off publication dates. A total of 719 full-

length articles were reviewed. Of those, 405 were excluded at a first pass review for the following: not

addressing a KQ of interest, not enrolling the population of interest, not meeting inclusion criteria for

clinical study or SR, not meeting inclusion criteria for any KQ, or being a duplicate publication. A total of


314 full-length articles were thought to address one or more KQs and were further reviewed. Of these, 217

were ultimately excluded and reasons for their exclusion are presented in Figure A-1.

Overall, 97 studies addressed one or more of the KQs and were considered as evidence in this review.

Table A-2 indicates the number of studies that addressed each of the questions.

#### a. General Criteria for Inclusion in Systematic Review

- SRs or clinical studies published on or after December 15, 2013 to March 25, 2019. If multiple SRs

```
addressed a KQ, we selected the most recent and/or comprehensive review. SRs were
supplemented with clinical studies published subsequent to the SR.
```
- Studies must have been published in English.
- Publication must have been a full SR or clinical study; abstracts alone were not included. Similarly,

```
letters, editorials, and other publications that were not full-length clinical studies were not
accepted as evidence.
```
- SRs must have searched MEDLINE or EMBASE for eligible publications, performed a risk of bias

```
assessment of included studies, and assessed the quality of evidence using a recognizable rating
system, such as GRADE or something compatible (e.g., the one used by the AHRQ Evidence-based
Practice Centers). If an existing review did not assess the overall quality of the evidence, evidence
from the review must have been reported in a manner that allowed us to judge the overall risk of
bias, consistency, directness, and precision of evidence. We did not use an existing review as
evidence if we were not able to assess the overall quality of the evidence in the review.
```
- Intervention studies must have assessed pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment and

```
have been a prospective, RCT with an independent control group. Crossover trials were not
included.
```
- Study must have enrolled at least 30 patients (15 per study group) unless otherwise noted (see

```
Key Question Specific Criteria below).
```
- Study must have enrolled at least 85% of patients who met the study population criteria: adults

```
aged 18 years or older who have or might be at risk for developing HTN.
```
- Study must have had follow-up data for at least 85% of enrolled participants.
- Study must have reported on at least one critical or important outcome of interest.

#### b. Key Question Specific Criteria

- For all KQs, SRs of clinical study types appropriate for the respective key question (as outlined

```
below) were the first line of evidence
```
- KQ 1: RCTs and diagnostic cohort studies that reported on the diagnostic characteristics of the

```
screening test (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, repeatability)
```
- KQ 2: RCTs or non-randomized, prospective comparative studies
- KQ 3, 4: RCTs, overall sample size ≥30
- KQ 5, 6, 7, 8: RCTs, total sample size ≥100
- KQ 9: RCTs or non-randomized, prospective comparative trials, total sample size ≥100;

```
retrospective comparative trials total sample size ≥400 (minimum 200/arm)
```
- KQ 10, 11: RCTs
- KQ 12: RCTs, non-randomized comparative trials, and diagnostic cohort studies

### C. Convening the Face-to-face Meeting

In consultation with the COR, the Champions, and the Work Group, the Lewin Team convened a three and

one half day face- to-face meeting of the CPG Champions and Work Group members on June 3 – 6, 2019.

These experts were gathered to develop and draft the clinical recommendations for an update to the 2014

VA/DoD HTN CPG. The Lewin Team presented findings from the evidence review in order to facilitate and

inform the process.

Under the direction of the Champions, the Work Group members were charged with interpreting the

results of the evidence review and were asked to categorize and carry forward recommendations from the

2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG, modifying the recommendations as necessary. The members also developed new

clinical practice recommendations not presented in the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG based on the evidence

review conducted as part of this guideline update. The Work Group members were divided into three

smaller subgroups at this meeting.

As the Work Group members drafted clinical practice recommendations, they also assigned a grade for

each recommendation based on a modified GRADE and USPSTF methodology. Each recommendation was

graded by assessing the quality of the overall evidence base, the associated benefits and harms, the

variation in values and preferences, and other implications of the recommendation.

In addition to developing recommendations during the face-to-face meeting, the Work Group members

also began to revise the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG algorithms to reflect the new and amended

recommendations. They discussed the available evidence as well as changes in clinical practice since 2014,

as necessary, to update the algorithms.


### D. Grading Recommendations

This CPG uses the GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence base and assign a strength for

each recommendation. The GRADE system uses the following four domains to assess the strength of each

recommendation:[18]

- Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes
- Confidence in the quality of the evidence
- Values and preferences
- Other implications, as appropriate,

```
♦ Resource use
```
```
♦ Equity
```
```
♦ Acceptability
```
```
♦ Feasibility
```
```
♦ Subgroup considerations
```
The following sections further describe each domain.

**Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes** refers to the size of anticipated benefits (e.g., increased

longevity, reduction in morbid event, resolution of symptoms, improved quality of life, decreased resource

use) and harms (e.g., decreased longevity, immediate serious complications, adverse event, impaired

quality of life, increased resource use, inconvenience/hassle) relative to each other. This domain is based

on the understanding that the majority of clinicians will offer patients therapeutic or preventive measures

as long as the advantages of the intervention exceed the risks and AEs. The certainty or uncertainty of the

clinician about the risk-benefit balance will greatly influence the strength of the recommendation.

Some of the discussion questions that fall under this domain include:

- Given the best estimate of typical values and preferences, are you confident that the benefits
    outweigh the harms and burden or vice versa?
- Are the desirable anticipated effects large?
- Are the undesirable anticipated effects small?
- Are the desirable effects large relative to undesirable effects?

**Confidence in the quality of the evidence** reflects the quality of the evidence base and the certainty in

that evidence. This second domain reflects the methodological quality of the studies for each outcome

variable. In general, the strength of recommendation follows the level of evidence, but not always, as

other domains may increase or decrease the strength. The evidence review used for the development of

recommendations, conducted by ECRI, assessed the confidence in the quality of the evidence base using

GRADE methodology and assigned a rating of “High,” “Moderate,” “Low,” or “Very Low.” The outcomes

judged to be critical were used to determine the overall quality of evidence. Per GRADE, if the quality of

evidence differs across the critical outcomes, the lowest quality of evidence for any of the relevant critical


outcomes determines the overall quality of the evidence for a recommendation; the overall confidence

cannot be higher than the lowest confidence in effect estimates for any outcome that is determined to be

critical for clinical decision making.[24,157]

The elements that go into the confidence in the quality of the evidence include:

- Is there high or moderate quality evidence that answers this question?
- What is the overall certainty of this evidence?

**Values and preferences** is an overarching term that includes patients’ perspectives, beliefs, expectations,

and goals for health and life. More precisely, it refers to the processes that individuals use in considering

the potential benefits, harms, costs, limitations, and inconvenience of the therapeutic or preventive

measures in relation to one another. For some, the term “values” has the closest connotation to these

processes. For others, the connotation of “preferences” best captures the notion of choice. In general,

values and preferences increase the strength of the recommendation when there is high concordance and

decrease it when there is great variability. In a situation in which the balance of benefits and risks are

uncertain, eliciting the values and preferences of patients and empowering them and their surrogates to

make decisions consistent with their goals of care becomes even more important. A recommendation can

be described as having “similar values,” “some variation,” or “large variation” in typical values and

preferences between patients and the larger populations of interest.

Some of the discussion questions that fall under the purview of values and preferences include:

- Are you confident about the typical values and preferences and are they similar across the target
    population?
- What are the patient’s values and preferences?
- Are the assumed or identified relative values similar across the target population?

**Other implications** consider the practicality of the recommendation, including resource use, equity,

acceptability, feasibility and subgroup considerations. Resource use is related to the uncertainty around

the cost-effectiveness of a therapeutic or preventive measure. For example, statin use in the frail elderly

and others with multiple co-occurring conditions may not be effective and, depending on the societal

benchmark for willingness to pay, may not be a good use of resources. Equity, acceptability, feasibility, and

subgroup considerations require similar judgments around the practically of the recommendation.

The framework below (Table A-4) was used by the Work Group to guide discussions on each domain.

Is this intervention and its effects worth

interventions?
Is there lots of variability in resource requirements
across settings?
```
```
Various considerations
```
The strength of a recommendation is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the

desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable effects and is based on the framework above,

which combines the four domains.[158] GRADE methodology does not allow for recommendations to be

made based on expert opinion alone. While strong recommendations are usually based on high or

moderate confidence in the estimates of effect (quality of the evidence) there may be instances where

strong recommendations are warranted even when the quality of evidence is low.[18] In these types of

instances where the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes and values and preferences played

large roles in determining the strength of a recommendation, this is explained in the discussion section for

the recommendation.

The GRADE of a recommendation is based on the following elements:

- Four decision domains used to determine the strength and direction (described above)
- Relative strength (Strong or Weak)
- Direction (For or Against)

The relative strength of the recommendation is based on a binary scale, “Strong” or “Weak.” A strong

recommendation indicates that the Work Group is highly confident that desirable outcomes outweigh


undesirable outcomes. If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and

undesirable outcomes, they present a weak recommendation.

Similarly, a recommendation for a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the desirable

consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences. A recommendation against a therapy or

preventive measure indicates that the undesirable consequences outweigh the desirable consequences.

Occasionally, instances may occur when the Work Group feels there is insufficient evidence to make a

recommendation for or against a specific therapy or preventive measure. This can occur when there is an

absence of studies on a particular topic that met evidence review inclusion criteria, studies included in the

evidence review report conflicting results, or studies included in the evidence review report inconclusive

results regarding the desirable and undesirable outcomes.

Using these elements, the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum:

- Strong For (or “We recommend offering this option ...”)
- Weak For (or “We suggest offering this option ...”)
- No recommendation for or against (or “There is insufficient evidence...”)
- Weak Against (or “We suggest not offering this option ...”)
- Strong Against (or “We recommend against offering this option ...”)

Note that weak (For or Against) recommendations may also be termed “Conditional,” “Discretionary,” or

“Qualified.” Recommendations may be conditional based upon patient values and preferences, the

resources available, or the setting in which the intervention will be implemented. Recommendations may

be at the discretion of the patient and clinician or they may be qualified with an explanation about the

issues that would lead decisions to vary.

### E. Recommendation Categorization

#### a. Recommendation Categories and Definitions

A set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used by NICE.[21, 22 ] These categories, along

with their corresponding definitions, were used to account for the various ways in which

recommendations could have been updated from the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG. The categories and

definitions can be found in Table A-5.


**Table A-5. Recommendation Categories and Definitions***

```
*Adapted from the NICE guideline manual (2012) [21] and Garcia et al. (2014) [22]

Abbreviation: CPG: clinical practice guideline

#### b. Categorizing Recommendations with an Updated Review of the Evidence

Recommendations were first categorized by whether or not they were based on an updated review of the

evidence. If evidence had been reviewed, recommendations were categorized as “New-added,” “New-

replaced,” “Not changed,” “Amended,” or “Deleted.”

“Reviewed, New-added” recommendations were original, new recommendations that were not in the

2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG. “Reviewed, New-replaced” recommendations were in the previous version of

the guideline, but were modified to align with the updated review of the evidence. These

recommendations could have also included clinically significant changes to the previous version.

Recommendations categorized as “Reviewed, Not changed” were carried forward from the previous

version of the CPG unchanged.

The “Reviewed, Not Changed” category was used for recommendations carried forward to the updated

CPG with review of the evidence and where no changes were deemed necessary to the recommendation

language. For recommendations carried forward to the updated CPG with review of the evidence and

slightly modified wording, the “Reviewed, Amended” recommendation category was used. This allowed

for the wording of the recommendation to reflect GRADE methodology as well as for any other non-

substantive (i.e., not clinically meaningful) language changes deemed necessary. The evidence used to

support these recommendations was carried forward from the previous version of the CPG and/or was

identified in the evidence review for the update.


Recommendations could have also been designated “Reviewed, Deleted.” These were recommendations

from the previous version of the CPG that were not brought forward to the updated guideline after review

of the evidence. This occurred if the evidence supporting the recommendations was out of date, to the

extent that there was no longer any basis to recommend a particular course of care and/or new evidence

suggests a shift in care, rendering recommendations in the previous version of the guideline obsolete.

#### c. Categorizing Recommendations without an Updated Review of the Evidence

There were also cases in which it was necessary to carry forward recommendations from the previous

version of the CPG without an updated SR of the evidence. Due to time and budget constraints, the update

of the HTN CPG could not include a review of all available evidence on management of HTN; instead, the

KQs were focused on areas of new or updated scientific research or areas that were not previously

covered in the CPG.

For areas of research that have not changed, and for which recommendations made in the previous

version of the guideline were still relevant, recommendations could have been carried forward to the

updated guideline without an updated SR of the evidence. The support for these recommendations in the

updated CPG was thus also carried forward from the previous version of the CPG. These recommendations

were categorized as “Not reviewed.” If evidence had not been reviewed, recommendations could have

been categorized as “Not changed,” “Amended,” or “Deleted.”

“Not reviewed, Not changed” recommendations refer to recommendations from the previous version of

the HTN CPG that were carried forward unchanged to the updated version. The category of “Not reviewed,

Amended” was used to designate recommendations that were modified from the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG

with the updated GRADE language, as explained above.

Recommendations could also have been categorized as “Not reviewed, Deleted” if they were

determined to be out of scope. A recommendation was out of scope if it pertained to a topic (e.g.,

population, care setting, treatment, and condition) outside of the scope for the updated CPG as defined

by the Work Group.

The categories for the recommendations included in the 2020 version of the guideline are noted in the

Recommendations. The categories for the recommendations from the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG are noted in

Appendix D.

### F. Drafting and Submitting the Final Clinical Practice Guideline..........................................................

Following the face-to-face meeting, the Champions and Work Group members were given writing

assignments to craft discussion sections to support each of the new recommendations and/or to update

discussion sections from the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG to support the amended “carried forward”

recommendations. The Work Group also considered tables, appendices, and other sections from the 2014

VA/DoD HTN CPG for inclusion in the update. During this time, the Champions and Work Group also made

additional revisions to the algorithms, as necessary.

After developing the initial draft of the updated CPG, an iterative review process was used to solicit

feedback on and make revisions to the CPG. Once they were developed, the first two drafts of the CPG

were posted on a wiki website for a period of 14-20 business days for internal review and comment by the


Work Group. All feedback submitted during each review period was reviewed and discussed by the Work

Group and appropriate revisions were made to the CPG.

Draft 3 of the CPG was made available for peer review and comment. This process is described in the

section titled Peer Review Process. After revisions were made based on the feedback received during the

peer review and comment period, the Champions presented the CPG to the EBPWG for their approval.

Changes were made based on feedback from the EBPWG and the guideline was finalized.

The Work Group also produced a set of guideline toolkit materials which included a provider summary,

pocket card, and patient summary. The final 2020 VA/DoD HTN CPG was submitted to the EBPWG in

March 2020.


## Appendix B: Patient Focus Group Methods and Findings

### A. Methods

As part of the effort to update this CPG, VA and DoD Leadership held a patient focus group. The patient

focus group was held on January 23, 2019, at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego, CA. The aim of the

focus group was to further understand and incorporate the perspective of patients with HTN and who are

covered and/or receiving their care through the VA and/or DoD healthcare systems, as these patients are

most affected by the recommendations put forth in the CPG. The focus group delved into the patients’

perspectives on a set of topics related to their HTN management, including their priorities, challenges they

have experienced, the information they received regarding their care, as well as the impacts of their care

on their lives.

Participants for the focus group were recruited by VA and DoD Leadership as well as by the HTN CPG

Champions. Patient focus group participants were not intended to be a representative sample of VA and

DoD patients. However, recruitment focused on eliciting a range of perspectives likely to be relevant and

informative in the guideline development process. Patients were not incentivized for their participation or

reimbursed for travel expenses.

The HTN CPG Champions and Work Group, with support from Lewin, developed a set of questions to help

guide the focus group. The focus group facilitator led the discussion using the previously prepared

questions as a general guide to elicit the most important information from the patients regarding their

experiences and views about their treatment and overall care. Given the limited time and the range of

interests of the focus group participants, not all of the listed questions were addressed.

### B. Findings

#### a. Provide comprehensive information and education to patients regarding their

#### condition, management strategies, and self-management, including expanding

#### available information on complementary and alternative therapies.

- Patients would like to be offered educational materials (e.g., pamphlets) as well as verbal
    communication of pertinent information related to their condition.
- Some of the patients felt that their providers did not offer the full range of management options
    available and seemed to prioritize pharmacologic interventions.
- Patients noted that there were many non-pharmacological management strategies that had not
    been offered to them and/or they were not aware of, including Tai Chi, yoga, meditation, etc.
- Some of the patients felt that their providers did not consider all of their individual, unique
    characteristics that could impact their high blood pressure and management strategies.
- Several patients mentioned that they did not receive information on the harms of having high
    blood pressure, including the increased risk of stroke, heart disease, etc. (i.e., education on the
    importance of treating and managing high blood pressure).
- Patients would like communication around the AEs of medication.


- Patients raised concern over AEs of medication and some noted that they wanted to avoid use of

```
medications, when possible.
```
#### b. Improve the method of measuring blood pressure in the office.

- Patients noted that when their blood pressure was measured by machine in the office setting,

```
they experienced pain and uncomfortable pressure.
```
- Some of the patients noted that their blood pressure had to be taken twice when in the office

```
setting, the first reading rarely being accurate.
```
- Patients felt that the office blood pressure readings were inaccurate; they trusted the devices they

```
use at home more.
```
- There were noticeable differences between blood pressure readings when it was taken manually

```
versus a machine.
```
#### management, including frequency of measurement, is important. c. Education around home monitoring devices and strategies for measurement and

#### and management, including frequency of measurement, is important.

- All patients noted that they have a device to monitor their blood pressure at home, however,

```
none of the patients had received instruction from their provider about how to use the device to
measure their own blood pressure.
```
- None of the patients reported having learned from their provider how often to measure their

```
blood pressure at home; the patients all reported different frequencies of self-monitoring their
blood pressure.
```
#### preferences regarding frequency of communication and mode of communication. d. Improve communication between providers and patients, considering patient

#### preferences regarding frequency of communication and mode of

#### communication.

- Patients felt that providers should listen actively to their patients and take into consideration the

```
patient’s other medical conditions (e.g., co-occurring diabetes, injuries/physical limitations) and
needs that may affect their treatment to provide a holistic approach to managing their HTN.
```
- Some patients appreciated and/or felt they would benefit from additional contact with their

```
providers in between their annual or bi-annual visits.
```
- All patients were interested in telehealth modalities to improve communication with their

```
providers and were willing to engage with providers through phone calls, email, or mobile
applications.
```
#### pressure. e. All patients understood the importance of lifestyle modifications to lower their blood

#### blood pressure.

- All of the patients reported closely monitoring and changing their diet when they learned of their

```
HTN diagnosis.
```
- All of the patients understood that they should decrease sodium and alcohol intake and should

```
not smoke.
```

- Most of the patients noted that they put a strong emphasis on staying active to improve their

```
blood pressure.
```
- Patients were interested in other complementary alternative therapies to improve their blood

```
pressure, such as meditation, yoga, and acupuncture.

## Appendix G: Guidance for Conducting Office Blood Pressure Measurement

The following information has been adapted from the 2019 AHA Measurement of Blood Pressure in

Humans.[ 36]

**Properly prepare the patient**

- Have the patient relax, sitting in a chair with feet flat on floor and back supported; the patient
    should be seated for 3-5 minutes without talking or moving around before recording the first
    blood pressure reading
- The patient should avoid caffeine, exercise, and smoking for at least 30 minutes before
    measurement
- Ensure that the patient has emptied his/her bladder
- Neither the patient nor the observer should talk during the rest period or during the measurement
- Remove clothing covering the location of cuff placement
- Measurements made while the patient is sitting on an examining table do not fulfill these criteria

**Use proper technique for blood pressure measurements**

- Use an upper-arm cuff blood pressure measurement device that has been validated and ensure
    that the device is calibrated periodically
- Support the patient’s arm (e.g., resting on a desk); the patient should not be holding his/her arm
    because isometric exercise will affect the blood pressure levels
- Position the middle of the cuff on the patient’s upper arm at the level of the right atrium (midpoint
    of the sternum)
- Use the correct cuff size such that the bladder encircles 75%-100% of the arm

**Table G-1. Proper Blood Pressure Cuff Sizes**

```
Cuff Size Arm Circumference (cm) Bladder Dimension (width x length, cm)

```
```
Large adult 35- 44 16×36
```
```
Extra-large adult 45- 52 16×42
```
Abbreviation: cm: centimeter

**Take the proper measurements needed for diagnosis and treatment of elevated blood**

**pressure/hypertension**

- At the first visit, record blood pressure in both arms; use the arm that gives the higher reading for
    subsequent readings (if consistently 10-15 mm Hg higher)
- Separate repeated measurements by at least 30 seconds


**Properly document accurate blood pressure readings**

- Record SBP and DBP
- Note the time that the most recent blood pressure medication was taken before measurements

**Use average the readings**

- Use an average of ≥2 readings for the visit blood pressure
- For initial documentation of the patient’s blood pressure, use an average of the visit blood
    pressures obtained on ≥2 occasions to estimate the individual’s blood pressure

**Provide blood pressure readings to patient**

- Provide patients their SBP/DBP readings both verbally and in writing; s omeone should help the
    patient interpret the results

What is above should be common to each appropriate standardized office blood pressure measurement

technique. The following are additional guidance specific for each technique:

**For fully automated office oscillometric manometer readings:**

- Preprogram the manometer to wait five minutes before inflation begins and to take and average
    2- 3 readings at least 30 seconds apart; the most common intervals are 30 seconds, one minute,
    and two minutes
- Position the patient and place the proper sized cuff on the upper arm before initiating the wait
    time and blood pressure readings
- Turn the manometer on and set controls to take inflate to proper level (above sensed SBP)
    automatically and measure and average multiple readings; press the button to initiate wait period
    and automated readings (fully automated)
- Patient should remain quiet and not use electronic devices (e.g., phones) during the rest period
    and readings; person measuring the blood pressure may remain in the room (attended) or leave
    the patient alone in the room (unattended), but no one should interact or speak with the patient
    during the rest period and readings
- After the rest and measurements are completed, record the average blood pressure reading
    displayed; manometer should display the average of the 2-3 readings (as preset)

**For standard technique with automated oscillometric device:**

- Use an upper-arm cuff oscillometric device that has been validated
- Position the patient and place the proper sized cuff on the upper arm before initiating the wait
    time and blood pressure readings
- Turn the manometer on and set controls to take/inflate to proper level (above sensed SBP)
    automatically
- Patient should remain quiet and not use electronic devices (e.g., phones), and no one should
    speak with the patient during the rest period and readings


- After the five-minute rest period, push the button to initiate the first inflation/reading; record SBP
    and DBP reading
- Take the next reading(s) with at least a 30 second interval between readings and record SBP and
    DBP readings displayed for each reading; record the average or median SBP and average or
    median DBP as the patient’s blood pressure

**For standard auscultatory technique with manual manometer:**

- Use an upper-arm cuff manual device that has been validated and recently calibrated; this includes
    a mercury manometer, an aneroid manometer, or an electronic manual non-oscillometric
    manometer for auscultatory determinations
- Position the patient and place the proper sized cuff on the upper arm before initiating the wait
    time and blood pressure readings
- Patient should remain quiet and not use electronic devices (e.g., phones), and no one should
    speak with the patient during the rest period and readings
- Use a palpated estimate of radial pulse obliteration pressure (disappearance or resumption of
    pulse when cuff is inflated/deflated) to estimate SBP; inflate the cuff 20-30 mm Hg above this level
    to perform the auscultatory determination of the blood pressure level
- Use either the stethoscope diaphragm or bell for auscultatory readings
- After the five-minute rest period, inflate the cuff and use auscultation to determine SBP and DBP;
    determine SBP and DBP as the onset of the first of at least two consecutive Korotkoff sounds
    (beats) and the last audible Korotkoff sound, respectively
- Record the SBP and DBP reading
- Take the next reading(s) with at least a 30 second interval between readings and record SBP and
    DBP readings for each reading; record the average or median SBP and average or median DBP as
    the patient’s blood pressure


## Appendix H: Guidance for Conducting Home Blood Pressure Measurement

The following information has been adapted from the 2019 AHA Measurement of Blood Pressure in

Humans.[ 36]

**Patient training provided by healthcare staff or providers:**

- Provide information about hypertension diagnosis and treatment
- Provide information on the proper selection of a device
- Provide instruction on how patients can measure their own blood pressure (if possible,
    demonstrate the procedure or instruct how to access training video)
- Provide instruction that the HBPM device and blood pressure readings (log or electronic recording)
    should be brought to healthcare visits
- Provide education that individual blood pressure readings may vary greatly (high and low) across
    the monitoring period

**Preferred devices and cuffs:**

- Use an upper-arm cuff oscillometric device that has been validated
- Use a device that is able to automatically store all readings, if possible
- Use a device that can print results or can send blood pressure values electronically to the
    healthcare provider, if possible
- Use a cuff that is appropriately sized for the patient’s arm circumference

**Table H-1. Proper Blood Pressure Cuff Sizes**

```
Cuff Size Arm Circumference (cm) Bladder Dimension (width x length, cm)
Small adult 22- 26 12×22
```
```
Adult 27- 34 16×30
```
```
Large adult 35- 44 16×36
```
```
Extra-large adult 45- 52 16×42
```
Abbreviation: cm: centimeter

**Best practices for the patient:**

- Preparation

```
♦ Have an empty bladder
```
```
♦ Rest quietly in seated position with back supported (e.g., leaning back in chair) for at least
five minutes
```
```
♦ Do not talk or text
```

- Position

```
♦ Sit with back supported
```
```
♦ Keep both feet flat on the floor
```
```
♦ Legs should not be crossed
```
```
♦ Blood pressure cuff should be placed on bare arm (not over clothes)
```
```
♦ Blood pressure cuff should be placed directly above the antecubital fossa (bend of the
arm)
```
```
♦ Center of the bladder of the cuff (commonly marked on the cuff by the manufacturer)
should be placed over the arterial pulsation of the patient’s bare upper arm
```
```
♦ Cuff should be pulled taut, with comparable tightness at the top and bottom edges of the
cuff, around the bare upper arm
```
```
♦ The arm with the cuff should be supported on a flat surface such as a table
```
- Number of readings

```
♦ Take two readings at least one minute apart in the morning before taking any
antihypertensive medications and two readings at least one min apart in the evening
before going to bed; some recommend only recording the second measurement
```
- Duration of monitoring

```
♦ Preferred monitoring period is ≥7 days (i.e., 28 readings or more scheduled readings); a
minimum period of three d ays (i.e., 12 readings) may be sufficient, ideally in the period
immediately before the next appointment with provider
```
```
♦ Monitoring conducted over consecutive days is ideal; however, readings taken on
nonconsecutive days may also provide valid data
```
- Analyzing readings

```
♦ For each monitoring period, the average of all readings should be obtained
```
```
♦ Some guidelines and scientific statements recommend excluding the first day of readings;
if the first day of readings is excluded, the minimum and preferred periods of HBPM
should be four and eight d ays, respectively

## Appendix K: Alternative Text Descriptions of Algorithms

### A. Module A: Screening and Diagnosis

1. Module A begins with Box 1, in the shape of a rounded rectangle: “Adult in healthcare system”
2. Box 1 connects to Box 2, in the shape of a hexagon, asks the question: “Is the patient currently
    being treated for HTN?”

```
a. If the answer is “Yes” to Box 2, then Box 3, in the shape of an oval: “Go to Module B,
Box 16”
```
```
b. If the answer is “No” to Box 2, then Box 4, in the shape of a rectangle: “Obtain office blood
pressure (see Sidebar 1)”
```
3. Box 4 connects to Box 5, in the shape of a hexagon, asks the question: “When measured properly
    (see Appendix G), is SBP ≥120 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg?”

```
a. If the answer is “Yes” to Box 5, then Box 6, in the shape of a hexagon, asks the question:
“Does patient have an acute injury or illness?”
```
```
i. If the answer is “Yes” to Box 6, then Box 7, in the shape of a rectangle: “Return
after acute episode resolved (typically within 4 weeks)
```
1. Box 7 connects to Box 4, in the shape of a rectangle: “Obtain office blood
    pressure (see Sidebar 1)”

```
ii. If the answer “No” to Box 6, then Box 8, in the shape of a rectangle: “Assess the
need for and implement lifestyle modification, then follow up for adherence
(e.g., diet, exercise, weight loss, alcohol moderation)”
```
```
b. If the answer is “No” to Box 5, then Box 15, in the shape of a rectangle: “Screen blood
pressure periodically; address other CV risk factors (including healthy diet and physical
activity); in patients with known or suspected target organ damage (see Sidebar 3),
consider possibility of masked HTN (consider HBPM or ABPM)”
```
4. Box 8 connects to Box 9, in the shape of a hexagon, asks the question: “Is SBP ≥130 mm Hg or DBP
    ≥90 mm Hg”

```
a. If the answer is “Yes” to Box 9, then Box 10, in the shape of a hexagon, asks the question:
“Confirm diagnosis of HTN by measuring blood pressure after 1-4 weeks (see Sidebar 2); is
diagnosis confirmed?”
```
```
i. If the answer is “Yes” to Box 10, then Box 11, in the shape of a rectangle: “Obtain
history and physical and assess for target organ damage and comorbid conditions
(see Sidebar 3); consider baseline testing (e.g., basic metabolic panel, urinalysis,
EKG, A1c, other tests), as appropriate”
```
```
ii. If the answer is “No” to Box 10, then Box 15, in the shape of a rectangle: “Screen
blood pressure periodically; address other CV risk factors (including healthy diet
and physical activity); in patients with known or suspected target organ damage
(see Sidebar 3), consider possibility of masked HTN (consider HBPM or ABPM)”
```

```
b. If the answer is “No” to Box 9, then Box 15, in the shape of a rectangle: “Screen blood
pressure periodically; address other CV risk factors (including healthy diet and physical
activity); in patients with known or suspected target organ damage (see Sidebar 3),
consider possibility of masked HTN (consider HBPM or ABPM)”
```
5. Box 11 connects to Box 12, in the shape of a hexagon, asks the question: “Is secondary cause
    suspected?”

```
a. If the answer is “Yes” to Box 12, then Box 13, in the shape of a rectangle: “Evaluate, as
indicated; consider referral”
```
```
i. Box 13 connects to Box 14, in the shape of an oval: “Initiate treatment (go to
Module B)”
```
```
b. If the answer is “No” to Box 12, then Box 14, in the shape of an oval: “Initiate treatment
(go to Module B)”
```
### B. Module B: Treatment

1. Module B begins with Box 16, in the shape of a rounded rectangle: “Patient appropriate for HTN
    treatment”
2. Box 16 connects to Box 17, in the shape of a rectangle: “Determine blood pressure goal
    (see Sidebar 4)”
3. Box 17 connects to Box 18, in the shape of a rectangle, asks the question: “Implement SDM to
    assess patient values and preferences; assess the need for and implement lifestyle modification. Is
    the patient willing to engage in pharmacotherapy?”

```
a. If the answer is “Yes” to Box 18, then Box 19, in the shape of an rectangle: “Initiate
treatment if drug naïve or optimize existing therapy (see Sidebar 5)”
```
```
b. If the answer is “No” to Box 18, then Box 20, in the shape of a rounded rectangle: “Patient
refuses pharmacotherapy; consider nurse-led and dietitian-led interventions to improve
blood pressure control”
```
4. Box 20 connects to Box 21, in the shape of a rounded rectangle: “Follow up periodically; reassess
    preferences”
5. Box 21 connects to Box 17, in the shape of a rectangle: “Determine blood pressure goal
    (see Sidebar 4)”
6. Box 19 connects to Box 22, in the shape of a rectangle: “Consider offering and/or adjusting HBPM
    with co-interventions (tailored medication titration, education, and/or lifestyle counseling”
7. Box 22 connects to Box 23, in the shape of a rectangle: “Follow up regularly (e.g., monthly) until:
    blood pressure is at goal, treatment regimen is optimized (see Sidebar 6), comorbid conditions
    and/or other patient preferences direct otherwise”


8. Box 23 connects to Box 24, in the shape of a hexagon, asks the question: “Is the patient’s blood

```
pressure at or below goal?”
```
```
a. If the answer is “Yes” to Box 24, then Box 25, in the shape of a rectangle: “Follow up
annually or more frequently as dictated by comorbid conditions (to include lab
monitoring, if indicated)”
```
```
b. If the answer is “No” to Box 24, then Box 22, in the shape of a rectangle: “Consider
offering and/or adjusting HBPM with co-interventions (tailored medication titration,
education, and/or lifestyle counseling)”
